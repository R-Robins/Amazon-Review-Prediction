The automatic autherntication does not work and the offline setup doesn't either. The super secret code it generates does nothing. You copy that to one window then type in the other super secret code that comes on the back of a book, hit authenticate or whatever and it terminates, saying you should make sure the unlock request is entered correctly. Well, yes you idiots, I know how to copy and paste. You cannot play even offline and you have to start all over again. There is a securerom link to go to if you can't get it working. It doesn't work either. It's so secure you can't access it. I do have the xbox version so I can play it but I prefer PC gaming.<br /><br />Maybe the steam version is the way to go. I haven't tried it and am not planning to buy the damn thing a third time but that might be the way to go instead of footling around with the disc version.

US,40751777,R3D7YPQQBVGRG5,B00IQCRKT8,575580052,Batman: Arkham Knight,Video Games,4,0,0,N,N,Color commentary,"There are some sports that are better live than on TV. Some of the intensity of hockey is lost on TV, the relaxation of watching a baseball game on a nice day surpasses sitting in the living room. But sometimes the commentary adds a lot to the game. A bit of context, some history, something you wouldn’t get being at the game itself.<br /><br /> I’ve played, and enjoyed, each of the Batman Arkham games that have come out. Arkham Knight is no different. It has an open world to explore, the same melee style combat and stealth action as previous games. There are a few additions to the game. A heavy dose of Batmobile, an overhaul of the game world into utter chaos, a new hierarchy of villains and a more involved cast of supporting characters. It’s the same style game revamped, and a little darker than previous installments.<br /><br /> The game picks up with the death of the Joker from Arkham Origins. It’s Halloween of the following year and after a threat to the city everyone but the police force evacuates as gangs and militia take over. The primary adversary through the game is the Arkham Knight, a militaristic, unknown villain who leads a mercenary army into Gotham under the direction of Scarecrow who is trying to release a massive dose of fear gas into the city.<br /><br /> There are two big additions to the game. The well-advertised, and a bit controversial Batmobile which can be switched between a high powered sports car and a tank. While the tank combat is enjoyable, though fairly easy since enemies telegraph their attacks, the heavy reliance on the Batmobile can become cumbersome. Flying from rooftop to rooftop is both enjoyable and quicker than driving through Gotham’s winding streets most of the time, but there are numerous sections of the game where the Batmobile is shoe-horned into the gameplay. Open up an area, go back for the Batmobile to open up the next section, rinse and repeat. While the car adds some nice variety to the game it can act like an anchor, slowing down gameplay by making you use it. The other big addition to the game is the Joker as a supporting character. This, to me, is the more enjoyable of the additions though it doesn’t really add anything to the gameplay. Through events in the game the Joker becomes part of Batman’s psyche, visible and audible to Batman, but no one else. He provides commentary on events and pokes at Batman’s actions. While the games are fun of their own right, the color commentary really adds something special to the game. It provides greater context of the events and humor in an otherwise serious game.<br /><br /> The world is very similar to the past two installments in the series, Arkham City and Arkham Origins, a sprawling cityscape of Gotham. The game takes place over the course of a single night so it’s always dark and raining from beginning to end. The main difference in the world is that the city has erupted into utter chaos. In the previous games gangs roved the city, but Arkham Knight takes it to another level as a militarized force has moved into the city alongside the normal array of gangs filling the city streets and making it more likely to run into a fight going from point A to point B.<br /><br /> The normal array of hand to hand combat and stealth carries over from the previous games. You swing from rafter to rafter or crawl through ducts taking out enemies one by one silently until you burst out, or the more likely scenario for me is being seen, for hand to hand combat. The same array of gadgets are available to you as previous games in the series, the bat claw, the disruptor for turning off weapons, smoke pellets, you get the idea, with a few new additions like a voice modulator, which really just put up more walls to progression that you unlock through the story. There is a new fear take down mechanism that allows you to do multiple takedowns in a short period, along with a series of new automated enemies such as drones you can hack and automatic turrets you must avoid. As mentioned before the Batmobile is now playable and there is a good amount of tank combat which is nimble and enjoyable. You steer the Batmobile which is able to move in all directions quickly, while you combat automated tanks which telegraph their attacks with light beams that change color when they have a lock. It makes the combat a bit simplistic, but it’s a nice change of pace from the normal melee combat you usually encounter in the games.<br /><br /> The graphics look great. The city is dark and ominous. The characters are well rendered and the voice acting is still superb. The main complaint I have with the presentation is there are times where Batman’s mouth doesn’t move while speaking.<br /><br /> There is a ton of side content, but it can be a little annoying. While the content itself is well-done, it involves finding it. Sometimes radio banter will alert you to where the event is, but even with that it can be difficult to locate at times. It would be nice if once you get a clue as to where the content is it would mark it, but it doesn’t. Sometimes I would hear some banter that would alert me. I would fly in the direction indicated but not see where the event was and there wouldn’t be any more banter.<br /><br /> Arkham Knight is a great game in its own right. It’s another high-quality installment in a great series. But the addition of the Joker to provide commentary really puts things over the top. It may not actually add anything to the gameplay, but getting a glimpse at Batman’s thoughts and insecurities is a great added bonus to the game. The commentary may not be a focal point, it may not be something any focused on, but it really adds something to the game. It can help fill in the gaps, it can help bring things alive, it can help give a glimpse at something I wouldn’t have been able to see otherwise. It also makes up for some of the short comings that have arisen with the new mechanics. The additional barriers to progression you have to unlock, having to hunt down side content or the sometimes overzealous use of the Batmobile.",2015-08-31

With each release, Disney manages to stuff their game with so many things to do, and 3.0 takes this further with a mind-boggling amount of content to tackle.  Long after many AAA hardcore games are completed, Disney Infinity will keep chugging along with something new to find. Having Star Wars to bring in their latest series was a no-brainer for Disney - and everyone predicted it would happen.  I'm happy to say, Disney went into overdrive with this release as they have done the Star Wars license mighty justice.  The gameplay is spot on this time with fun quests and tons of side missions. Unlike the previous Marvel Super Heroes, Star Wars's missions vary from ground  to space, keeping the adventures fresh at all time. The combat is highly improved with spectacular moves that are more complex and satisfying. I mean, come on - lightsabers? That's all you need to know.  Both Twilight of the Republic and Rise against the Empire are equally enjoyable, and even after completion, you'll be back to revisit and will find much more to do.<br /><br />Back on Earth, without even firing up one of the Star Wars Playsets, you'll find an overwhelming amount to explore, thanks to the Toy Hub (not to be confused with the Toy Box). The Hub is the center for everything.  It's segmented like a pie, with one section for racing, another combat, platforming, etc.. Each section has an intro level and sub levels that you can play which introduce you to the game's mechanics. It's brilliantly put together. One particular area host a farming simulator for your sidekicks. Oh, sidekicks are mini-sized Disney characters that hang with you during your questing. They can be told to follow and fight along, or farm for vegetables and other surprises. As your crops grow, you can feed your sidekicks to increase their stats. Better stats equals more abilities like cooler weapons, and other interesting gear. It really adds an RPG feel to the infinity series, and those little folk are pretty kick butt in battle! When I first heard about farming being added to the series, I was scratching my head, but from what I heard, people are spending hours just in that section alone!<br /><br />The Disney Main Street area of the hub is a sight to behold, and it's here where you can stop at Flynn's Arcade (of Tron fame) to jump into some on-line multiplayer games, or hang out at the El Capitan theater and play community levels, or even watch videos based around the game. Trust me when I say, the Hub is going to keep you real busy.  And finally, there's the Toybox, the heart of the Disney Infinity empire.This time around, the ToyBox has received a lot of new gadgets and scenery, so expect an abundance of community levels that utilize the new features.<br /><br />Besides the two Star Wars PlaySets, there is currently a third which is based on Pixar's awesome animated movie,  Inside Out. This takes a different approach than the other sets, as it brings pure 2D/3D platforming bliss to the table, and dazzling it is!  Then there are the two expansion games. Unlike the playsets, which come with characters and an adventure crystal, these expansions are just a special single disc. When dropped on the portal, they add an all new game to the already massive mix; currently, there are two:  Toybox Takeover which is a dungeon crawler where any Disney/Marvel/Star Wars Character can quest , and the highly touted DI Speedway, which is a Mario Kart-like racing game. All these sets unlock even more toys to add to the already massive selection in the Toybox.  Oh, and if that wasn't enough, there's more DI goodness coming down the pike later later this year,  including a new playset based on the upcoming, highly anticipated movie in the Star Wars saga,  The Force Awakens, and an all out brawl fest titled Marvel Battlegrounds which will support four player combat.<br /><br />With all the excellence that is 3.0, there are a few things that I feel need attention:<br /><br />- Saving a game on the Disney Cloud using the PS4 is still super slow. I'm not sure how is is on other formats.<br />- Some of the tools in the Toybox I thought would have made the jump to light speed like the rest of the game, instead, they remain the same, like the yellow trigger cube which is cumbersome to resize.<br />- The Toybox still restricts certain actions to a certain type of toy. For example, if you want a particular object to be &#34;collectible&#34; in a quest, you can only use what the developers chose as a collectible item. At least there's a better selection than last year.<br />- This year's amazing new path creator is great for making objects follow an assigned path. It will surely take community games to a whole new level. The first thing that came to my mind when I read about the Path Tool's capabilities was ROLLERCOASTERS! Well, turns out - there's no coaster track,  train track, or even a coaster car. There are coaster sounds effects, though? Odd, right?<br /><br />In closing, there are so many features with Disney Infinity 3,0, it would be painful to have to write a review and list them all. Whether you're 6 or 65, you're in for one of the big gaming treats of 2015.brawl fest titled Marvel Battlegrounds which will support four player combat.

In terms of graphics they are decent, but even walking around causes the game to twitch and lag. Its a chore just to get from one side of a town to another. Then in battle sometimes the game doesn't load the enemy animations when you hit them at first so they just kind of stand around like they are not sure what's going on. If you can look past all of that you then have the constant fear that the game will crash, and you WILL not get through a play through without it crashing, you just have to hope you don't lose a character and have to start all over (that one happened to me... Thanks lionhead). For some positives the story is ok and the characters are engaging enough to hold your attention.

Now, as far as the &#34;feel&#34; of a controller in my hands, this is hands down, the VERY best of them all!  The feel, the look, the touch screen on top.  Everything works perfectly to give you that great gaming experience.  However, when it comes to the components that make up the insides of the controller?!  Well, that's a completely different thing.  The trigger buttons are plastic and when you get to shooting those bad guys, well, the plastic tends to tear apart.  This happened to me while playing [[ASIN:B00SHXKC8M Borderlands: The Handsome Collection - Playstation 4]].  I played through the original Borderlands, the 2nd, and even the 3rd (prequel) on my Xbox 360, MULTIPLE times, without having a problem.  However, only a few hours into this game, the trigger pin shattered, leaving me without a gun in the middle of Pandora?!<br /><br />Apparently, this is a rather common problem as you'll find countless videos about it on Youtube.  Do yourself a favor and go purchase R2 & L2 replacement buttons from eBay.  That way if you do find yourself with a broken controller, you can fix it right up.  And it is rather easy to fix.

EA has become infatuated with selling virtual football cards for hundreds of dollars and gimmicky drafts with dead  and retired football players on Ultimate Teams, and in the process has destroyed the core game.<br /><br />CFM mode fantasy draft is virtually useless.  You are unable to sort by categories and higher overall rated players are rated less than the mysterious rating placed upon players by EA.  This is worse than the so called perfect players.  I am a JJ Watt fan but 99 in all categories? This is getting ridiculous.  They've changed things that didn't need changing.  Some VP at EA must've had their 12 year old nephew rate the players.<br /><br />They are so enamored with one handed catches by receivers that the rest of the game doesn't work.<br /><br />Case in point.<br /><br />Just played game with Eli Manning after CFM fantasy draft.  On 2nd and three Manning throws a 27 yard pass to Avant who catches and runs for 8 more yards.  After great fanfare by Sims and company, the game cycles to the next play and its mysteriously 3rd and ten and the announcers are talking about how terrible the offense has been playing.<br /><br />Later in the fourth quarter my DB intercepts a pass on the 1 yard line.  Next play Manning takes the snap to throw from the end zone.  The line holds, no one in the backfield.  The play freezes and it says its a safety, and wants me to punt.  Manning is standing there holding the ball.<br /><br />Continually you select a play and when you go to choose a hot route, not only does the art disappear.  But the play that starts is not one you've selected, and its not even in your list of audibles.  The tight ends disappear.  This is the worst Madden ever.<br /><br />This  list  of wierdness could go on forever.  Don't buy it.  Go back to Madden 15 until they fix it.. Maybe 2 years from now.  These are not small glitches.  These are major problems.  It is totally unplayable.<br /><br />EA thinks that eye candyand one handed catches can distract you enough to realize that you can't even play the game.",2015-08-31

Anyway, to me it was worth it to play Peacewalker with dual analogs and the Ashley Wood motion comics with full voice.  Be advised though:<br />-No art book was included (I understand this is a second printing)<br />-MGS and MGS VR Missions are both downloads via code included on paper insert.  Have not tested if they work on the Vita yet.<br />-Both motion comics are on Disc 2.  When loaded, look under the &#34;Video&#34; icon on the PS Home Screen.<br /><br />Enjoy!",2015-08-31

First off, the base is well made and looks good on a table. The characters are incredibly detailed and are worth it even if you don't own Disney Infinity. You can set the difficulty of the game so kids and adults can enjoy it. I love the whole atmosphere of the game and the creation aspect since you can do pretty much anything you want to do.<br /><br />If you have a Disney Infinity game already then I suggest not upgrading to 3.0 until you get a next gen console. This game is getting quite big and if you want to build bigger worlds and enjoy smoother gameplay then get it when you get a next gen console. This upcoming black friday would be a great time since this game would probably drop a lot and so will consoles.",2015-08-31

Unfortunately it isn't as ambitious as it could be.  While I enjoyed my time and recommend it to others, the choices you make only affect what may or may not happen to a character, but not the overall story.  This was what I found to be disappointing.  Some main characters, no matter what decisions you make, will always be in the final chapter.  Only then can you decide if they live or die.  I won't necessarily say I felt deceived, but played instead.<br /><br />The game said I can choose who to save or let die.  While that's true, the game sells itself short by not letting players ultimately decide when and where it can necessarily happen.  The game uses a butterfly effect system that notifies players when future events have been altered by the choices they just made.  This system could have been more revolutionary if the game wasn't so restricted with its storytelling.<br /><br />The most simplest way I can explain this is that each character, besides the main ones, are being strung along for the ride.  They each have their particular moments for them and them alone.  It's the player's job to make sure they get there by not cutting the cord with the decisions they make or don't make at a designated time.  Ultimately, the game has a story to tell and will tell it regardless if you want to play along or not.<br /><br />This game and future games like it can improve by allowing some deviation from the main plot.  Even letting players choose the blue pill (Matrix reference).  If Neo takes it, there is no story or film.  For example, I wouldn't mind if I played the game in a way everyone died within the first couple of hours and it was game over.  Characters shouldn't have their set paths unless we can decide how they get there.  This is ultimately where I would like this genre to go.  If it doesn't, we're just being pulled along as well.eady been written by the choices you made prior.&#34;  You can see the pros and cons to this, but ultimately the decision made by the developers encourages more replay-ability.  Normally I would frown upon this, but the game isn't that long.  It's about 8-10 hours depending how much you explore.  It's split up in to chapters so a replay isn't much of a chore.  All you have to do is put up with the unskippable cutscenes, but the acting is well done and you can make certain changes to them with the choices you make.  All in all, this game was better than I thought.  I was expecting another The Order, but having an interactive experience with good characters in an overall fun story.  The game is definitely worth your time.  Controls leave more to be desired, but games like this are a good alternative to the norm and leave hope for more old school style Survival Horror games.",2015-08-31

The blue light can get distracting, so you might want to put some electrical tape over it if it is in your line of sight.  The fan comes on automatically when the PS4 is on, and shuts off with the PS4, if you are powering it via the USB port on the PS4.  You can also manually shut if off by pushing the button on the front.    It's well made and does its job.

This game will keep you as the player engaged from start to finish. As some games like this type lose steam towards the end, Until Dawn keeps steady from start to finish. I beat this twice in 24 hours just because I was drawn into the story.<br /><br />Very impressive with the graphics and the feel. Sometimes the frame rate is quirky in some spots but nothing noticeable to most casual players. While the camera angles do not adjust much, this adds to the appeal and creep factor this game has. Controls make sense as it makes your characters look and react with a sense of reality that applies to this game.<br /><br />The game play itself has a great balance of presenting the story but making sure you are ultimately in control. Tensions grow as you run through areas making sure anticipate your next action, but you cannot over commit as the command may change or speed up. Your choices matter for the most part and are hidden all throughout the game. You don't ALWAYS know what choice you make is that pivotal moment in a characters life and that makes it exciting.<br /><br />So why 4 stars? As much as I love it, I would not spend 60 dollars for this game. I feel its appeal is awesome but will fade after about the 3rd play through. While it would be nice to say I wish this game would be bigger, that's not the case. The design of the game itself just becomes self limiting at points. DLC would be great, but besides the bonus chapter for preorders, I doubt that will happen.<br /><br />In short, your first playthrough will be amazing and create an experience that you will remember for a long time however multiple playthroughs may diminish your overall return and you may question how far your 60 bucks went when compared to a title like the witcher 3 or metal gear solid v.",2015-08-31

The build quality surprised me as it is metal and extremely sturdy. I feel like I could drop this from a second floor window and it would shrug it off. I'm no pro at any fighters and I bought this for MAME, but to me all the buttons feel clicky and satisfying to press.

It came with absolutely everything I needed (except instructions).  You watch a couple youtube videos and proceed with caution, and you too can be an engineer (or at least feel like one for a day). I wont lie, this took me more than four hours total work time, but I was very deliberate and cautious-- I was really worried about damaging those tiny components.  After doing it, I feel like I could have worked with a heavier hand. The back of the unit comes without the black layer of what appears to be insulation and the front comes without the thin plastic frame you will need if you want the unit to fit as snugly as possible.  Both of these can be removed from the damaged unit with a little steam and a thin blade.  the screen protector they threw in was unnecessary; I spent a lot of time trying to apply it without airbubbles.  ultimately I just didnt use it since there wasnt one on my original anyway.",2015-08-31

I thought I'd never say that again after COD Modern Warfare, but it's true it's true! Gameplay was fun and almost fresh, almost, I really dug the exo suit abilities kinda like TitanFall minus giant robots but with an actual campaign. Controls are tight and responsive and the voice acting was better than I expected, so good in fact my wife actually sat and watched many of the cut scenes and she almost never does that for any game. To recap an immersive story, some of the best graphics on the Xbox 1, good controls, different abilities different feel thanks to the exo suits, good voice acting. Why then only four stars? well I'm glad you asked...I got through the campaign in about 7-8 hrs...on veteran, not too big of a deal i know cod games are all about the multiplayer but I have always played the main campaign before jumping into an online match and, this was one of the easiest campaigns to get through on veteran that I can remember take it as you will it is what it is. Installation although not really a part of the gameplay itself, It is part of the whole experience. Installation from a disc took ver 3 hours not cool, I realize its a large file almost 50 GBs, but come on over 3 hours really? not for a download but rather a simple installation, C'mon?<br />DISCLAIMER: This review is for the main campaign ONLY not the multiplayer. But I will add my two cents for those of you who trash the matchmaking cause you can't prey on the newer or lesser skilled players so you can bolster your stats are you serious!? are you serious!? shame on you, ya'll need to get a life. If you feel you are that good on ANYTHING in life, challenge yourself against like minded and similarly skilled competitors or opponents and stop bitchin' about not being able to take advantage of the COD skill impaired cause that ain't cool and you look petty and childish (unless of course you ARE a child), in which case I would suggest you put forth all that energy and effort on become a better human being rather that a better COD player, again just my two cents...Game on and prosperlife, challenge yourself against like minded and similarly skilled competitors or opponents and stop bitchin' about not being able to take advantage of the COD skill impaired cause that ain't cool and you look petty and childish (unless of course you ARE a child), in which case I would suggest you put forth all that energy and effort on become a better human being rather that a better COD player, again just my two cents...Game on and prosper",2015-08-31

But first let's start with the major downside: bugs. The game is buggy, with some rare framerate issues, and as of writing this review there is at least one quest that is unfinishable because of a weird bug (Skellige's Most Wanted), but luckily CD Projekt Red is constantly releasing patches so soon the game will be perfect! Besides this though, I do consider this game perfect. The combat is amazing, and extremely fun, and although it is quite difficult in the beginning, it gets easier. I recommend playing on the &#34;Blood and Broken Bones&#34; difficulty. The graphics, although slightly glitchy at times, are beautiful. The world of the Witcher 3 is one of the most beautiful, and expansive that I have ever seen. This is my first Witcher game, and it is easy to get into, although I do recommend reading the books (I'm currently reading Time of Contempt) because not only are they great, but also will make your gameplay experience that much better.

You can play for 30min then the sounds goes completely hay wire. Sounds very very strange and hurts my ears. I had commented on it below. The robotic sounds. Very disappointed. I will never buy anything from turtle beach again they've sold their good name to the Chinese to maximize profits. Shame on them.<br /><br />they disconnect from sound completely and have to be re-paired very often. 2-3 times through 5hrs of playing.<br /><br />Every couple hours they will also sound like a really weird robot electronic sound. Very very strange sounding. Can't play a game at all with it when it does this. Hurts my ears. Again only way to fix is re-pair/sync them, but be prepared to do it often. Not reliable.<br /><br />Max Volume is okay, honestly I think it's 20% lower then my turtle beach X32. And they were as loud as I like anything. These will never hurt your ears on full blast by a long shot. They get loud enough to be okay, but not LOUD.<br /><br />The whole charging thing lol. Yeah they are constantly on when charging. No way to turn that off. Just turning them down is all. So if they are off and you plug them in to charge they will come on and stay on while charging.  Only thing you can do is turn volume down on them. That is a massive engineering mistake. Someone should have their rear end paddeled like a small toddler....then appropriately be fired.<br /><br />The presets are a joke. I mean a real joke. Like the designers were laughing when they saw them being put on a truck and being shipped out. All presets sound very very close tothe same.<br /><br />These are wireless.

It's time to leave turtle beach where they belong. On the curb wearing useless headphones.<br /><br />They used to be pretty good. No more. They are trash.<br /><br />Update......

(also, play the eShop demo)","Fantastic game overall; if the &#34;Sonic Boom&#34; branding scares you, don't let it. This is one of the best Sonic outings in years.<br /><br />Sonic Boom is a GORGEOUS 2.5D entry in the series that pulls it's characters and settings from the Sonic Boom branch of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. That means it's a sidescroller like classic games, but with 3D graphics - think something like Donkey Kong Country Returns if you haven't heard of the term &#34;2.5D&#34; before. The title incorporates elements from a lot of quality sidescrollers - including world map screens similar to various Mario titles, team based gameplay with unique powers like in The Lost Vikings, expansive maps with hidden paths only accessible with specific skills a la Metroid - and meshes them all with quality Sonic gameplay.<br /><br />If you just play through the stages as fast as you can, you'll enjoy a Sonic game with great level designs that's a little less precise than the best games in the series, but has a focus on tricks & special moves to engage instead of asking for precision all the time. With the characters' new &#34;electro whip&#34; thingie, they can now swing from grapple points, and with their individual abilities, all the platforming becomes something special. You'll end up pulling off combos like run &#62; jump &#62; swing &#62; air dash &#62; slam down into a zip boost &#62; grind &#62; bounce pad &#62; swing, etc. So the classic-ness of the gameplay, while a little less fast and a little less precise, is actually a lot more engaging and rewarding to play. The game does bring the speed though, it's just metered out a little better than in previous sidescrollers. The camera is also a lot better and more dynamic, with a nice amount of &#34;lead space&#34; (the distance between the front of your character and the edge of the screen) so you actually have enough time to see obstacles coming and AVOID them. Crazy!<br /><br />The game is a bit of an &#34;adventure&#34; in that you'll need to return to areas with new characters to gain access to different chunks of the levels and collect different doodads. Collecting doodads is important for a few reasons, namely you need them to access new levels (they're locked and require a certain number of emblems - obtained by finishing the stage, finishing it under a certain amount of time, collecting all the crystal shards in the level, etc. - to unlock), and you need blueprints to get Tails to build you upgrades. These upgrades apply to all characters, and include awesome things like destroying enemies by running through them, revealing item locations on the level map, or adding a &#34;Ring Vaccuum&#34; effect to your character so you can grab them by merely getting close to them, instead of having to get through them. A fully powered up character at the end of the game is a big improvement from one at the beginning, so the upgrades are important. Luckily going back into the levels with new characters and using their abilities are really fun. Tails lets you use fans in the level since he can glide, and he also has a toy submarine that lets you access a mini-game to get things too. Knuckles and bust through certain materials and tunnel underground, and Sticks has a boomerang that you can control around in the air - very useful for anything really, but specifically for hitting switches and turning off traps. Our main man Sonic however can air dash, which gives him the ability to reach out of the way areas (&#34;L shaped&#34; moves; air dashing straight up and right, for instance) and bust through blue blocks. You'll see all these &#34;hooks&#34; while making your way through levels, so you're going to WANT to explore further. And with Tails' upgrades, you won't be wandering around aimlessly - you'll see the items on your level map, know where you need to go, and just have to find the way to get there and pick the character who can do it.<br /><br />The levels are really well designed in general, and - like I said before - gorgeous. This is one game where you'll want to crank the 3D up from time to time, because the depth in the game is really nice. There's a great mix of foreground, mid and background objects and the camera's dynamic; the 3D really makes it look like a diorama with it's mix of depth. All the models & textures look great too - this is one of the nicest looking games on 3DS for sure. It all moves at a smooth clip too. All the worlds are very distinct in aesthetic and feel from one another too. All the levels are built to accommodate both speeding through, with a default &#34;middle track&#34; and exploration, with additional &#34;upper and lower tracks&#34;, to every level. So you'll end up exploring above, below and all over your main track on subsequent playthroughs, but it's always off to the side the speedier stuff - it never gets in the way. They're really good level designs that they function so well just racing through or slowing down and taking your time.<br /><br />Sonic Shattered Crystal is super enjoyable once you come to terms with it's little oddities. Namely how progression works (gotta get those emblems!) and the less-precise-than-other-Sonic-sidescrollers controls (well, that's not true. It's better than Sonic 4 Part 1 and the Sonic Rivals games). It's gorgeous, the elements it adds to Sonic gameplay are fresh and welcome, the way it handles team based skills works beautifully, there's loads of content here, and it's just a blast to play. Highly recommended - but you don't even need to take my word for it. There's a demo for Sonic Boom on the 3DS eShop - just give it a play. This game is rad and deserves a purchase if you enjoy quality sidescrollers and Sonic games. Also, be on the lookout for it's sequel coming up this year: Sonic Boom Fire & Ice. It's from the same developers and looks to be as good as this one while adding in more to the formula.<br /><br />Fun fact; the developers of this are Sanzaru Games. They're also the studio that makes Sly Cooper for Sony now (Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time for PS3/Vita is freakin' fantastic as well, I should point out). Sony only deals in quality platformers - just look at Jak & Daxter, Ratchet & Clank or Ape Escape - so when Sega gets the makers of Sly Cooper to make a Sonic game, you would figure it would be good, right? Well it is. It's an absolute - baffling - shame that so many outlets refused to cover this and instead focus on the disaster of the console game.ike I said before - gorgeous.

Do not buy.,"I purchased this headset with the intent of using it with my PS4. A USB dongle is provided in box for pairing with the PS4, and it is stated that the mic will pair with other bluetooth devices without the dongle. This mic does in fact pair with the PS4 when the dongle is used, unlike what is stated in the other review.<br /><br />The problem is that the audio quality is terrible. I don't know whether this is due to the dongle doing a bad job at transmitting and receiving audio, or just the headset itself, but the quality is unbearable. The input/recording quality is pretty bad, but almost tolerable. The output/playback quality is potentially worse than what you would hear out of a cassette player that survived a nuclear fallout that's playing at the other end of a noisy tunnel. It's choppy, cuts in and out, and is just plain awful. Do yourself a favor and do not purchase this mic.<br /><br />Aside from the garbage audio quality, everything else seems OK. The build quality is decent, and it's generally pretty comfortable. It's a shame, I thought I could finally have a wireless chat headset for my PS4, but this one is a significant downgrade from the default mic provided with the PS4, and I'll be returning it.",2015-08-31

I grabbed it used at Best Buy for $14.99. I've played about 2 hours and haven't gotten very far. AI is horrific, you can execute an enemy next to another enemy and still not get noticed. The sound is below par, I mean it's like going back in time to older WWII shooters. Graphics are probably the worst I've seen to date for a shooter. Everything blends together so you have a terrible time finding enemies during a fight. The controls make you feel disconnected from the game, they are unresponsive, laggy when they do work, and clunky feeling. Game runs like garbage too, fps dips a lot, the entire UI is laggy too. The finished game actually feels like an alpha stage game. Stick away from this game, I don't know if I can finish it, it's pretty bad. Shame on the developers for releasing it this way.

US,37932477,R2FJ94555FZH32,B00WJ0Z194,116945357,Infinity 3.0 Starter Pack,Video Games,2,55,60,N,N,"Some improvements on 2.0, but many game-breaking flaws remain","While Infinity 3.0 improves upon 2.0 in a number of ways: somewhat shorter load times (though still often close to 2 minutes long), better (though far from perfect) control of vehicles, the inclusion of Star Wars and loads of other content, there are some borderline game-breaking issues, some of which are inexcusable holdovers from 2.0.  Oh, and way too much Jar Jar Binks...<br /><br />If you don't want to read the full review, here's the executive summary:  1) You cannot play the play sets on line; 2) If you play split screen, player 2 will not earn in-game currency, will not earn achievements, will not unlock any of the toys or sidekicks, and will not level up their figure for when they go back to solo play; 3) The system of sharing of figures (i.e., between family members) is so convoluted that I've yet to find an explanation on Disney's site that is understandable; 4) This game is plagued with so many bugs/glitches that it's hard to play a session without encountering one.  The one I experience almost every time I play is the sound effects cutting out, but not the music, often requiring a restart of the game.<br /><br />Now the longer review...<br /><br />First, like Infinity 2.0, my son and I are unable to join each other's game via Xbox Live.  The invitee always gets dropped to the dashboard.  I went back and forth with Disney support on this with 2.0 and they told me that they were aware of the issue in 2.0 but that I should be confident that it would be fixed by 3.0.  It was not.  This game crashing also occurs in the Flynn's Arcade portion of the game and I've seen other users on Infinity forums say they also have this issue.  It seems to be an issue with both the router/modem used by Comcast and the one used by AT&T U-Verse.<br /><br />The really sad thing is that even if we were able to connect, we wouldn't be able to play the campaign / play sets together over Xbox Live anyway.  Yep, you read that right -- the story mode &#34;play sets&#34;, like the Star Wars campaign that comes with this game, cannot be played over Xbox Live.  If you want to play with a friend, you have to play split screen.  I'm not sure if the upcoming expansions for Toybox Takeover and Toybox Speedway will support online play or only split screen.<br /><br />So we play it split screen -- which brings us to our next issues.  Whoever is playing as the 2nd player does not get any credit for the sparks (the game's currency for purchasing items in the toybox mode) he collects.  My son had 307 sparks when he and I started a session, and though it read over 4000 after we played a few missions, it was back to 307 when he fired up a single player session.  Worse than this, though, is that he didn't get any of his character leveling progress.  Also, player 2 cannot earn achievements in split screen.  Oh, and any toys or sidekicks that either player in split screen unlocks only go to player 1.  Player 2 is relegated to &#34;tag along&#34; status.<br /><br />Why on earth would anyone want to play as player 2 if they aren't going to get in game currency, toys or have their character level up?!?<br /><br />For a game that clearly seems to have a community and family focus, the inability to get a multiplayer game to function properly baffles me.  Furthermore, as a game clearly geared toward kids (and kids at heart), there are some enormously frustrating platforming portions of this game.  My 15 year old son, who is no slouch at gaming, said, &#34;I have no idea how Disney expects an 8 year old to be able to complete this&#34; during one mission where we both died so many times we were ready to give up.<br /><br />Also, if you are annoyed by Jar Jar Binks -- and who in their right mind isn't? -- there's about 20 minutes of the Twilight of the Republic play set that will have you ready to throw your controller at the screen.  I truly cannot fathom why Disney would interject such a huge dose of Jar Jar into this game.  It is worse than the movies.  Seriously.<br /><br />If Disney fixes the multiplayer issues and cleans up the numerous bugs, this turns into a solid 5-star game for me.  Really, there is such an amazing amount of content and creativity in this game, it's a shame to see it hobbled by the issues above.  That's what makes all of this so sad -- this game truly has the potential to be absolutely amazing, but instead it just leaves me shaking my head in disappointment.<br /><br />I will say that Disney's tech support, despite being unable to solve my son's and my inability to play a game over Xbox Live, have been very pleasant and prompt in replying to me.  Unfortunately, I've about hit my frustration threshold with this game and am ready to throw in the towel.r /><br />If Disney fixes the multiplayer issues and cleans up the numerous bugs, this turns into a solid 5-star game for me.

First off, the base is well made and looks good on a table. The characters are incredibly detailed and are worth it even if you don't own Disney Infinity. You can set the difficulty of the game so kids and adults can enjoy it. I love the whole atmosphere of the game and the creation aspect since you can do pretty much anything you want to do.<br /><br />If you have a Disney Infinity game already then I suggest not upgrading to 3.0 until you get a next gen console. This game is getting quite big and if you want to build bigger worlds and enjoy smoother gameplay then get it when you get a next gen console.

Maybe I was getting lag from plugging this into a hub, but it just worked better overall with the adapter.<br />Buttons are okay. They respond well enough, but don't have a lot of tactile feedback. The stick has too much play, but simple tape remedies this easily. That's the only mod I've felt the need to do on this joystick: it's otherwise a competent entry-level stick that will keep you in good gaming times for a while. An octagonal restrictor, or at least something better than that dumb plastic washer, wouldn't hurt...<br />I've won records in games like Super Crate Box and Blazblue using this stick, which to me means that it works well and quickly, without introducing any serious lag.<br />You can do a lot better for a lot more money/work, or you can do a lot worse for about the same price. I don't know of any other good mid-/entry-level sticks that are still commonly available. Of those that are, most seem to be for the PS2, so again, if you want this sort of thing for PC gaming, I recommend a USB adapter over whatever firmware is built into these things.

This game delivers so much suspense on different levels.  Not only do you have to have quick reflexes to survive, you have to carefully consider the decisions you make.  The game seems like it can go a lot of different directions so the replay value is there.  Gorgeous graphics and great cut scenes.  I really enjoy the diversity in the characters and i found myself really caring what happens to each of them, all but one anyway.  The only thing that turned me off from the game at first was the wonky camera angles, but you get used to it and I think it does make things more cinematic and suspenseful at times.  All in all the Butterfly system, storyline, characters, and action sequences made up for the lack of control in camera viewpoints and character movement, so if this bugs you at first as it did me, give the game a chance.",2015-08-31

The first truly wireless headset that I've seen, the PDP AG7 is comfortable -- even with my large head. All of the other Xbox One headsets I've tested have a wire for chat that runs from the headphones to your controller. Not the PDP AG7. The key is in the clever USB transmitter that plugs into the Xbox. It connects automatically so you don't have to struggle with those awkward BlueTooth connection processes.<br /><br />One feature I especially LOVE is the separate dials for Chat and overall game volume. No more messing about with the plus or minus tabs trying to strike a balance. The PDP AG7 gives you the control to dial down (or up) chat with a dial. The same with game volume.<br /><br />The overall sound during gameplay is amazing. I can now hear when enemies are behind, to the left or right -- or above me in games like Titanfall. LOVE the sound.<br /><br />The on/off button is on the outside of the left hear piece. Just tap during game play to mute your microphone.<br /><br />The only ding for the PDP AG7 is that the mic is way too sensitive. It picks up everything -- the ceiling fan included in my case. I wish the mic were only calibrated to picking up your voice. Not a huge deal but annoying. Also, when you mute yourself the tip of the microphone (which is blue or red (extra bass)) flashes periodically to let you know you're on mute. I could see it out of the corned or my left eye (even when retracted) so I put a little piece of duct tape on it. Problem solved.<br /><br />Overall though this is by far the best headset for Xbox One I've come across. Comfortable. Excellent sound -- and truly wireless. Two thumbs up for the  PDP AG7!",2015-08-31

First off, the base is well made and looks good on a table. The characters are incredibly detailed and are worth it even if you don't own Disney Infinity. You can set the difficulty of the game so kids and adults can enjoy it. I love the whole atmosphere of the game and the creation aspect since you can do pretty much anything you want to do.<br /><br />The reason I dropped this to four stars was because 3 Hours into the game I was editing a home in split screen when the PS4 told me that the game save had become corrupted and everything was deleted which is quite unfortunate. The levels of the characters stay in tact but I still loose all progress made in the game and I have no idea why it happened. Hopefully it doesn't happen again. If you have kids or are a star wars/disney fan then I highly recommend this game, it's just a fun time!<br /><br />Update 8/30<br />It happened again, it appears to be a bug when you add a room in certain places in your INterior so I would recommend that you don't do much in your INterior until Disney sends out an update to patch the bug.<br /><br />Update 8/31<br />It happened again during a toy box build when putting just a few things down. This time it didn't erase all the game save, if this happens to you then don't close the game/app. Just hit continue and get back to the main menu so you start from your last checkpoint, hopefully they fix this soon since it is a bit inconvenient.",2015-08-31

I bought this bundle just in case I lose it because it did fall off several times and once you get use to how it feels, its hard to go back to the original controller. I feel naked without it. I wish it was all black too so it match my controller but on the other hand I have black carpet so its hard to find it if it drops. 4 stars because it needs variety of colors and it falls off easily sometimes (maybe glue might work).",2015-08-31

From watching the PGA Tour on TV,  most of the pros can win with 10 to 15  under par for the 4-round tournament.  Also, using the analog sticks to hit the ball proved exceedingly difficult.  I do not intend to spend 100 hours of practice to use the analog sticks.  What saved the game for me was the option to use the Swing meter get much better consistency of a golf shot than using the analog sticks.  Also, the unlocking of Pro Shop items and cover stories was confusing.  I was hoping that as I got better, more golf courses would be unlocked, but I did not notice that.

My hands are average, not large (yes, I checked) and palming this with the rearmost part of it actually touching my palm (you know, palm-grip - the very comfortable way of making the mouse support your hand and not the other way around, with the round part that fits exactly into the lower region of one's palm being in the lower region of one's palm) means my fingers overshoot the tip by almost an inch on the middle finger, so I am forced to either use a claw grip or a fingertip one.\<br /><br />Also, the finish very clearly marks with grease from the fingers, and doesn't clean particularly well for being sanded plastic.",2015-08-31

It also has it's flaws which at times really can be upsetting.  First let me try to explain why i think this is a good game. I think the first thing i noticed when i popped the disc in and loaded it up was the Graphics. They are truly representative of the ps4 potential. The graphics are top notch. The cars all look beautiful, the weather, the sun and lighting effects are all realistic. You can change the time of day in most races and if u happen to be driving while the sun is setting... Well you're gona have a bad time because the sun will be blinding. But at the same time thats pretty darn impressive.  Another thing this game has going for it is the simplified/stripped down approach to racing. No silly story here. In fact right after the loading screen, you are put behind the wheel of a Mercedez Bens AMG. Not even a tutorial if i remember correctly. But thats what i like! Thats what i expect from a racing simulator. No silly story that doesnt make sense. No annoying anouncer telling you to slow down on your turns. Nothing. Heck not even a soundtrack unless you change the default settings and turn the voulume up from its original 0% it's meant to be all driving and focus on the sounds of the cars.  Ah yes the cars.. This topic is somewhat difficult.  Yes we already established that they look good, they sound good... But do they handle? Well see here's where driveclub can become an issue if you dont know what it's trying to acomplish. This game is a pure racing simulator. No forgivness. No rewind no nothing. So yeah the cars will perform as they're supposed to. Dont expect a Hyper car to handle all fine and dandy when your going 180+ mph. They all have a unique handling.and especially so depending on the weather condition. If its raining and you're in that rwd car haulling ass... Forget it. You're toast. All the cars required me to do a practice run and then go for the real race.... And i would still come out 5th place. This also has to do with the AI which is yet another thing that grinds my gears when playing this game. Just picture them as beyond professional. They are not intimidated by you and they follow a perfect line all through the track. Im serious this game will require multiple runs through an event. But yet it is still fun. Because it's really satisfying to fail a couple of times and then finally get in the zone and come out on top. Truly satisfying.  Just be prepared. This is no need for speed.  Ah yes now is everything all worth the pricetag? Well.. I would say it depends. I spent about 25 bucks. Amazon at the time that i am writing this is out of stock but that doesnt mean you cant price match it at a store! Thats what i did. I showed em the 25 dollar price. And they matched amazon. However apart from That i spent another 25 for the season pass which is the cheapest method to obtain ALL the dlc and extra cars. Without the dlc you miss out on a ton of stuff. So if u plan on playing this without the dlc then i would say its not worth it. You will be missing out on a lot.  But for 50 bucks total spent. Im really enjoying this game.  So here's a basic good/bad summary of the game  GOOD: Visuals, Sound, weather effect, simplified racing approach, cars are demanding yet rewarding to drive  Bad: AI will have you beat often. No ability to change AI Dificulty, incomplete roster of cars/events if you dont purchase season pass DLC. Does this game require patience? Yes.",2015-08-31

I have a couple cats that love chewing on USB / charging cables.  We did not want the clutter or the risk of chewed cables by charging our controllers with USB cables.  This dock works great.  The design is self-centering.  The key is to place the controller in the cradle and let it rest which perfectly centers the controller in the cradle.  Then press down on top of the controller to activate the spring loaded charging cradle.  When it is time to remove the controller, press down on top of the controller to deactivate the spring loaded charging cradle and then remove the controller.<br /><br />It would be easy to try and insert and later remove the controller as a single motion but you might not get the flawless action that way -and may risk damage to your controller or the charger.  I think some of the bad reviews are from people attempting this instead of the two-step method of first letting the controller rest in the cradle and then pressing down to activate the charger.<br /><br />One of the best features of this unit is it does not use the front USB ports of the PS4.  This is a deal breaker of other charger designs when you need to use the PS4 USB ports for other things like the wireless headset dongles.",2015-08-31

This is going to be a review for X Men VS Street Fighter on The Sega Saturn. This was the home version of X Men VS Street Fighter to have & I'm not the only who believe's that. This game is loads of fun & The Saturn shows off how good the backgrounds look it's pretty much the arcade so the backgrounds look like a comic book the animations are all there & you can team up 2 characters like in The Arcade & Tag them in & out which The Playstation didn't have & having that was a big selling point. This game went on to have Marvel Superheroes vs Street Fighter & 3 Marvel vs Capcom games. The Street Fighter characters look like they do in The Alpha series. The X Men characters look like they do from the animated series from the early to late 90's. You have Ryu, Ken, Akuma or Gouki in The Japanese version. Charlie Chun Li, Cammy M Bison or Vega as he's called in The Japanese version. Zangief Dhalsim on The Street Fighter side. On The X Men side you have Magneto, Sabertooth, Juggernaut, Cyclops, Wolverine, Gambit, Rouge & Storm. There's really no story in this game only you team up 2 fighter fighter through 6 battles then fight Apocalypse in weird boss battle & whoever dealt the final blow to Apocalypse then you fight your partner at the end of the game. I know I make this sound uninteresting but this is an excellent game. The control's are great the gameplay is fun there is some replay value. The graphics are really good. If you have MAME there's no reason not to play this if you have a Saturn & an Action 4 In 1 Cart it is pricey however it won't break the bank like with Guardian Heroes or Street Fighter Zero 3. So my next review will be for Street Fighter Zero 3 imo the best version of the game.",2015-08-31

That is until I got Unity.  Like many AC fanboys, I got this game out of sheer loyalty to the series, and the only thing I feel good about is that I didn't pay the full price for it.  Even getting it at $20 is still much, because then you have the problem of slogging through this beast of a game.  First off, this game is massive, and not in a good way.  Oddly enough the campaign is the shortest of any of the AC games, and just as forgettable.  What is amazing is the insane amount of side quests you are given to play.  That would be cool if they where all fun, but a lot of them are like just going though the motions.  There are 30 &#34;companion missions&#34; where all you do is run a ways and then just kill some random dude.  Such fun.  Some of them are interesting like the murder mysteries, but most of them are a chore to play.  Side missions should be what they are, not 80% of the freaking game!  You can do Co-op missions, and they are okay, if you actually get paired with someone doesn't run off and let you do all of the fighting.  Even after all of the patches, I still get game crashes, character freeze ups, and wonky controls.  The controls feel the worst of any AC game.  Trying to navigate Arno in stealth positions is annoying to say the least, and negates the best thing AC had to offer, and that was stealth play.  In this game you move a little bit, get spotted and just slug it out 8 dudes.  Seriously, that's the game.  The graphics where outstanding, you could easily fall in love with moving about the city.  Also, the customizing Arno was the best part of the game.  All of the color options, and trying on different parts of armor kept this game tolerable.  I really liked the detail in the belts, braces, hoods etc.  I don't recommend putting any more than 20-25 hours into this game.  I finished the campaign, about 50% of the side missions, and just said screw it.  This game showed to me that the series has officially run it's course.  A real shame, because this was a good series, but this is what happens when greedy game companies have to shell out half-assed games every year, instead of 2-3 years.  It's because fanboys like me will still by games out of loyalty.  Well no more.",2015-08-31

I've also used this with drive club on PS4 and Gran tourismo on PS3, but the FFB is not near as strong with those games.<br /><br />Only complaint-the FFB weakens when the wheel gets hot (known issue) which is noticeable during longer races.

It's basically an interactive story because each decision you make has a direct effect on things that happen later in the game. The controls feel a little off at times but this isn't much of a complaint because they work fine during action sequences. Graphics look good but not great.

All deserve game of the year awards.  Thief is NOT a stellar or ground breaking game.  But that does not mean it is bad.<br /><br />I get the feeling folks were disappointed in this game because earlier games in the series were so highly rated.  But this is my first Thief game so I had no expectations.  Got the game free with &#34;games with gold&#34; promotion.<br /><br />Graphics and framerate are technically good.  Artistically I disliked the lack of colors, which is a typical problem with games running the Unreal engine.  Other complaints about the graphics: lots of load screens moving through the city, textures take time to load, self shadows are poorly done.  Still, overall above average.  And I think stable framerates really help playability in fps games.<br /><br />I like sneaking games like Splinter Cell, Hitman, and Metal Gear Solid.  This game plays in a similar fashion, even if it is not in the same league as those 3.  Downside is that combat is not a viable option unlike in those other games.  Sniping with the bow works fine though.<br /><br />Exploring the city is one of the best parts of the game.  There are lots of collectibles and side missions to do.  This game should keep you occupied for quite a while (unless you get bored).<br /><br />Story was not compelling, nor were the characters.  I did find some bugs with characters speaking and subtitles sometimes not happening at the right time.<br /><br />Overall, an average game.  Nothing horrible about it, but lots of little things wrong with it.  Best for gamers who like sneaking games.  Probably worth it at a heavily discounted price (say, under $10).",2015-08-31

For the longest time, I've been saying that Madden needs a definitive turnkey/pivotal title that'll be the true platform to continuously build the game up from.  Madden 16 to me is definitely that benchmark title as the feel of football is true and completely undeniable regarding what's going on here for sure.  Let me get into this a bit deeper.<br /><br />WR/DB Interactions: Out the box, you had a good number of people on the EA access 10 hour trial screaming out how catching was OP (overpowered), and were getting caught over end over end on deep balls in 1 v 1 situations mainly.  That's just the issue there though, people needed to learn how to use the new in game mechanics.  The days of just pressing Y or Triangle are gone.  You must learn to press A or X and play the receiver, spotlight the receiver if your secondary isn't great, assign the extra man or adjust your playcalling to have that safety over top to defend those situations just like they do IN REAL LIFE!!  There's only a few DBs/Safeties in the league that are great 1 on 1 defenders, and even they get additional support as they'll get beat too (ex: Patrick Peterson vs Amari Cooper is a great example of this).  If there were anything I'd say was an issue with this, it would be the frequency of one handed catches that would need to be toned down a bit.  Otherwise, I strongly suggest people get in the skills trainer and practice field and learn how to effectively use the mechanics instead of making the blind complaints because you're not winning like you were used to back then.  Times are changing for real now!!!<br /><br />QB Pass Placement/Inaccuracies/AI: In Madden 15 the pass innacuracies were introduced, but due to community complaints, it was toned down and the &#34;Robo QB&#34; was back in full effect.  This year it's back and not going anywhere.  In addition to dedicated pass placement mechanics, you have the most control since the PS2 days when it comes to how you want to deliver the ball, high over the shoulder lobs, mid-level passes that'll sail over LBs and in that hole within the zone where only the receiver can get it, or throwing it low and away so the risk of a pick on that curl or comeback route is reduced to nil and would only be a drop or a breakup by defender contact.  Now you can clearly see the CPU AI difference between Geno Smith and Tom Brady when it comes to how they are at making reads, accuracy on throws, and how they also deal with defensive pressure when the pocket collapses.<br /><br />Run Game/Trenches: Regarding the running game this year, the controlled player movement is greatly improved, as the ballcarrier feels much more weighed down and attached to the field.  Especially when it comes to making quick cuts, and bursting through holes, even when utilizing skill moves too, the footwork is highly noticeable and the player movement is the best out of ANY football game out in my opinion.  When it comes to the run game and reading blocks, you MUST BE PATIENT!!  You have to allow the blocks to develop and make the proper reads instead of mashing turbo and getting stuffed prematurely.  Speaking on the Trenches the O-Line/D-Line battling is much more balanced and the sack totals aren't nearly where they were in the history of the franchise.  Now it's more of a progressive win/loss battle to get into the backfield, unless you have a beast like JJ Watt/Gerald McCoy/Ndamukong Suh on the line you're controlling.  Even with that in place, with the CPU QB AI, they don't hold the ball nearly as much as they used to and will already have made their read and threw the ball, or will try to buy time by moving in or rolling out the pocket and throwing the ball away.<br /><br />Penalties: The final part to discuss here are the penalties, they're FINALLY back and count more than a way of impacting how gameplay outcomes are potentially determined like in years past.  Now the sliders determine the frequency of what penalties get called.  What I like even more is that when the penalties are called, there are clear animations to show what had happened onfield.  Whether it's a holding, PI, facemask or an illegal block in the back, they all have a visual depiction to go along with what penalty took place.  They still are lacking every penalty legible for the game at this point, and also a challenge system a la NFL 2K5 where I can choose what I want to challenge regardless of what took place on the field instead of the game dictating what can or can't be challenged.  Once again, this is a legit foundation to build upward from.<br /><br />In closing, these gameplay refinements make this the most realistic playing Madden title to date, and these past 3 games (Madden 13 - 15) were the building blocks that helped 16 set itself up to truly be great going forward.  With some tuning/patching within these core gameplay aspects.  Madden 16 can be a truly official title to set the tone of true football authenticity and replication for the future of this franchise.",2015-08-31

(Of course, I didn't pay very much and didn't expect alot from these toys.) I will say that I have never held a guitar, nor played Guitar Hero or Rock Band. (I was worried about getting this set.) I bought an xbox for my son and picked up Lego Rockband, Band Hero and Aerosmith Guitar Hero(Gig didn't work for Aerosmith game) just because I like music and thought it would be fun to give rhythm games a try. So I purchased the band set just for the drums and guitar because the set was cheaper than ANY other peripherals for these games. (Like New, but everything was in original packaging. Thanks DirectDeals4U!)<br /><br />I have not played the enclosed game or used the mic. I have not used it on an amp, and probably will not use an amp, as I am not a guitar player. This is just for fun.<br /><br />The guitar is pretty cool. It took a minute to get use to. I found that it's easier to play games with the strings unmuted. Unmuted only requires strumming down/plucking on beat to the music and you don't have to press the strings on the neck to get the notes to register, but I press them to stop the string feedback. When muted you must strum and press hard on the strings on the neck of the guitar to get the notes to register. [Muted makes my fingers hurt, but I see how to move my fingers on the guitar.]<br /><br />The drums were odd at first. The airstrikes register well enough. Like one other post said, sitting the drums on the floor at an angle works best. My little one has banged the sticks on the drums a number of times by accident and they still work fine. It's not typical drumming but I don't have to listen to constant banging when L.O. wants to play...off beat...while the baby is sleeping. The flashing LED light when you strike over the color pad helps. (We're not drummers so not too worried about the drumstick feedback.)<br /><br />Overall,  the peripherals work enough to enjoy the game. I had to try different ways to play the guitar in practice mode to see which method helped to get the highest score in LRB and BH. I have small kids so I didn't want to spend alot of money on band items for a video game. This gets the job done. Kids enjoy it, I enjoy it, my wallet enjoyed the price point. ☺<br /><br />Serious /super competitive gamers may want to pass this by because the guitar isn't super sensitive and you will do some work to get the notes to register at times. Just have to find what works for you with these band items.<br /><br />Purchased this set all in good fun.n practice mode to see which method helped to get the highest score in LRB and BH.

Now I like giving others a try and having boys who destroy headsets I personally don't buy Turtle Beach for them but get them cheaper versions. This I got for my 14yr old who games more than he reads.<br /><br />I decided to test this headset out for myself while doing the Gears of War beta. Now if you're a big fan of FPS then you know why games prefer the Turtle Beach headsets. With a TB you feel like you're right there in the game. Sounds is amazing and you can't beat that. These on the other hand, the sound wasn't spectacular but at this price I wasn't really expecting them to be. The set up was easy enough and I was able to wear them for about an hour before they started to feel irritating around my ears. TBH that's a problem I have with most headsets anyway because of the bulkiness. They do feel comfortable once you put them on and the padding is enough to not make my ear hurt on instant contact.<br /><br />Now I did have a bit of problem with the mic. It seems like I had to shout a little louder for my teammates to hear me. Not something I want to be doing in the middle of the night. I seem to be hearing them ok but they couldn't hear me well. Besides that small issue these would have been a great headset. Maybe they could get that sorted out.<br /><br />Now if you have kids and don't want to spend the money for a Turtle Beach then this is a safe bet.",2015-08-31

US,22788662,R3VC0HCN87EN7F,B00ZSJUTCM,838780144,Disney Infinity 3.0 Edition: Star Wars™ Saga Bundle - PS3,Video Games,5,10,12,N,N,Star Wars time to shine in Disney Infinity 3,"In Disney Infinity 3.0, it is time for Star Wars to shine.  The Disney Infinity 3.0 Star Wars Saga Bundle includes The Twilight of the Republic Starter Pack, Rise Against The Empire Play Set, Boba Fett and as an added pre-order bonus, Toy Box Takeover Expansion Game.  If you had played previous Disney Infinity, you know what to expect.  For those who haven't, Disney Infinity 3.0 gives you the opportunity to play with toy versions of Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka Tano, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Boba Fett.  And for those who played with Kenner toys, this is a walk into memory lane, where you get to play with much better articulated versions of the heroes of the Star Wars Saga and with toy versions of their vehicles.  Indeed, this is a blast from the past.<br /><br />Twilight of the Republic Play Set<br /><br />This play set stars the adventure going back to Geonosis.  The game looks like Clone Wars and it feels every bit of a Clone Wars episode, with cameo appearances by Yoda, Obi Wan Kenobi and Plo Koon.  It starts heavily combat oriented following a mission oriented game play.<br /><br />Update Oct 17 (A major bug and minor spoiler!)<br />----------------------------------------------------<br />I finally got to play this Play Set.  I encountered a nasty bug when you try to get off Geonosis for the first time.  I had to start a new game two times until I figured a way to pass through the bug.  I used Anakin and when to the left space port, the one with the green down arrow.  You know if you are ok if you drop above Geonosis space in the middle of a space battle.  Deal with all enemies before going to Coruscant.<br />----------------------------------------------------<br /><br />There are 11 types of coins ( 1 coin each) that you want to collect to unlock eleven characters: Boba Fett, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Darth Vader, Darth Maul, Kannan, Ezra, Sabine and Zeb.<br /><br />Rise Against The Empire Play Set<br /><br />This play set starts the adventure with the capture of the Tantive IV by Darth Vader, just where A New Hope starts.  And you get cameo appearances by Han Solo, Chewbacca, C-3PO, R2-D2, Darth Vader and Ben Kenobi.  The character are stylized versions of these Star Wars characters, a similar to Clone Wars animation, but a bit softer on the edges.  You get to Tatooine, right to Mos Eisley, and visit familiar places like the Cantina or Jabba's Palace.  You get to do a lot of exploration if you want, flying Sky hoppers or racing land speeders.  I even got to put batteries on a Yawa's transport, open it up and climb on top.  I'm not sure how close this &#34;toy&#34; represents the one from Kenner's (I didn't owned one), but I was gleefully playing with it as such.<br /><br />You get a lot of the usual missions, fetch me something or attack my enemy but with the Star Wars flavoring.  Missions are marked yellow, blue and purple.  Yellow mission are critical to move the plot line.  Of course, you can eventually proceed with the story that takes you through A New Hope to Empire Strike Back and Return of the Jedi.<br /><br />However, once you get to the next place, say you got to Hoth, you still have the choice to go back to Tatooine to take care of any incomplete mission or try to go for the three stars on any one completed with a low score.  In other words, it is a bit open ended following the Original Trilogy storyline with variations since all our four heroes are available all the time.<br /><br />There are 11 types of coins ( 1 coin each) that you want to collect to unlock eleven characters: Boba Fett, Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka Tano, Obi Wan Kenobi, Yoda, Darth Maul, Darth Vader, Kannan, Ezra, Sabine and Zeb.<br /><br />There are several types of capsules that you can open:<br />- Blue Capsules - Increases spark count<br />- Green Capsules - Increases healing meter<br />- Orange Capsules - Increases level meter<br />- Purple Capsules - Increases special meter<br /><br />Star Wars Characters<br /><br />The Star Wars Figures included in the Star Wars Saga Bundle are: Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka Tano, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Boba Fett.<br /><br />Anakin Skywalker<br />The sculpt of this figure is very good.  He look similar to a combination two of the last Hasbro figures from Clone Wars, with a beefier physique.  He is preposed in an aggressive, almost crouching stance.  His paint is mostly flawless, with some prominence to the scar over his right eye and a bit of green tone on his lightsaber which should be blue like Luke's.  He stands on a sandy/clay surface.  His main attack (press Triangle button) consist of a series of lightsaber swings.  His ranged attack (press R2 button) consist of a Force assisted charge and attack.  His dodge (press Circle button) consist of Force assisted skipping front, back and side-side.  His special ability (press R1 button when full meter) consists of using the Force to rip the ground and used as missiles against his enemies.  He can also use the Force to do a Force Pull in combat.<br /><br />Ahsoka Tano<br />The sculpt of this figure is just amazing.  She looks very similar to the one from Hasbro, but preposed with an attitude, her lightsaber drawn back.  Her paint is flawless, with large and expressive eyes. She stands on an sandy/clay surface.  Her main attack (press Triangle button) consist of a series of double lightsaber swings.  Her ranged attack (press R2 button) consist of a Force assisted charge and attack.  Her dodge (press Circle button) consists of acrobatics flips front, back and side-side.  She can also use the Force to perform a Force Push in combat.<br /><br />Luke Skywalker<br />The sculpt of this figure is very good.  He look strong, but not a beefy as Anakin.  However, these figures seem to be at the same height, mostly because Anakin is practically crouching on his guarded stance, while Luke stance is higher.  His taint is mostly flawlessly, with sandy hair.  He stands on a reflective black panel.  His main attack (press Triangle button) consist of a series of lightsaber swings.  His ranged attack (press R2 button) consist of firing his blaster and the auto-lock works pretty well.  His dodge (press Circle button) consist of roll front, and skipping back and side-side.  His special ability (press R1 button when full meter) consists of harnessing the Force to cause more damage, and using a Force assisted charge instead of blaster for ranged attack.  He can also use the Force to pull objects (press Square button).<br /><br />Princess Leia<br />The sculpt of this figure is just amazing.  She wear her iconic hair style and is preposed with on a guarded pose with her blaster ready.  Her paint is flawless, sporting her white tunic. She stands on a reflective black panel.  Her main attack (press Triangle button) consist of a series of martial kick moves reminiscent of Mrs. Incredible minus the stretching powers.  His ranged attack (press R2 button) consist of firing her blaster and the auto-lock works pretty well.  Her dodge (press Circle button) consist of skipping front, back and side-side.  Her special ability (press R1 button when full meter) consists on calling R2-D2 to attack her enemies.<br /><br />Boba Fett<br />The sculpt of this figure is just great.  He wear his Mandalorian armor preposed with his shotgun-blaster ready.  However, his paint really intrigue me.  It is a combination of styles from A New Hope to Empire Strike Back to Return of the Jedi.  His pants are gray like in Empire, his jacket under the armor is light gray like in A New Hope and Return of the Jedi.  However, his left bracer, shoulder pads and knee pads are mustard, but his right gauntlet is brown.  The original Kenner figure had mustard left bracer, shoulder pads and knee pads, but reddish right bracer.  In Return of the Jedi, his bracers were brown.  Anyway, he stands on a reflective black panel.  His main attack (press Triangle button) consist of a series punches culminating with afire of his rocket from his back pack.  His ranged attack (press R2 button) consist of firing his blaster and the auto-lock works pretty well.  His dodge (press Circle button) consist of skipping front, back, and side-side with assisted backpack.  His special ability (press R1 button when full meter) consists on firing a rocket from his backpack at one enemy.<br /><br />As your character gains experience, points can be allocated to buy skills from the character skill tree. This time around the skill tree is separated on four branches: Health & Defense, Special Ability, Melee Skills and Ranged Skills.  There is also a character overview.<br /><br />Toy Box Takeover Expansion Game<br /><br />This game is an expanded version of the Hexagonal Game Discs like Escape from Klyln or Brave Forest Siege.  However, in this game mode, any Disney inanity can play, which makes it interesting for previously Toy Box only characters.  The story stars with Syndrome, the bad guy from The Incredibles, stealing Mickey's Magic wand.  It is actually and enjoyable Toy Box game.<br /><br />The Toy Box<br /><br />The Toy Box in Disney Infinity 3.0 included are: New Treehouse Toy Box, Empty Toy Box, New Race Track Toy Box, New Terrain Toy Box and New INterior.<br /><br />There is also a Hall of Galactic Heroes, a Hall of Super Heroes, a Hall of Heroes, My INterior and A Galaxy of Stories (introductory mini adventure).<br /><br />Final Notes<br /><br />The improvements in Disney Infinity 3.0 are not as noticeable as they were for Disney Infinity 2.0.  Also the number of discs for the first wave is very reduced (14), but no more blind bags.  However, I would be amiss if I did not mention that everything that makes Star Wars is in this game.  From the Star Wars musical score to lightsaber battles to starfighter dogfights.  Everything is there.<br /><br />Star Wars Music<br />That's all I need to say.<br /><br />Lightsaber Battles<br />These are not your hardcore lightsaber battles, but enjoyable all the same.  You control your character from a third person perspective.  The controls are simple with Square button for Force Pull, Triangle button for Lightsaber swing, R2 trigger for Force Charge, Circle button for Dodge and X button for Jump (Force Jump if holding the button).  After getting some levels up, other special maneuvers are available.  Not your typical click fest on your Triangle Button, but a timed target on a bar at the bottom of the screen indicating when a button must be push to get a combo.  By the way, sometimes on a final kill the camera slow down to give emphasis to the cool maneuver.<br /><br />Starfighter Dogfights<br />Against, these are not your hardcore first person perspective dogfights, but enjoyable.  You control the starfighter on a third person perspective.  However, there is a circle indicating where the starfighter is targeting.  These starfighter differ from other flying vehicles as the starfighter is constantly moving.  Pressing L2 makes it stop while pressing R2 makes it accelerate,  In the case of the X-Wing, accelerating means closing the S-Foils while going faster.  When this happens, the X-Wing can not fire.  Firing is done by pressing Triangle button.  The X-Wing fighter makes the satisfying laser fire sounds that are close to those of the movies.  These starfighters can also perform special maneuvers like a turn around flip, or flip left or right for dodging.  This is performed by the flick of the Right Thumbstick up, down, left or right.  If you had played the X-Wing Miniature Game, you are in familiar territory.  These game mechanics are simple enough, but satisfying.<br /><br />Overall, if you liked previous installments, chances are you are going to like this one.  There are no many Disney Originals yet, but if you like Star Wars and Disney mixed together, this game is right in your alley.l.

US,47029376,R1W49KWY4BL00M,B0047TLIBU,187179975,Dragon Age 2,Video Games,4,0,0,N,N,"Very enjoyable! Not perfect, but fun!","I will get the negative out of the way first:<br />1. Reuse of dungeon maps is so frequent that I can't just give the game a pass for being fun.<br />2. Like Mass Effect (all of them), I kept saying to myself, &#34;Why on earth would you say that??&#34; This was not a deal breaker, and it was not overly frequent, but it happened enough that I felt compelled to mention it.<br />3. I would have liked to have had more mention of the character from Dragon Age Origins, especially if that character was a mage.<br />4. Way too many blood magickers, and it seems that all you have to do to become a blood mage is to get angry and slit your wrist while posing, spraying out more blood than a human body can realistically hold.<br /><br />Now, positives:<br />1. This game is beautiful! The graphics are a huge improvement over Dragon Age: Origins and awakening, which I had no complaints about.<br />2. Your character has a voice! And a darned good one at that! He sounds a bit like Obi Wan Kenobi's big brother if you play the male Hawke.<br />3. Combat for the console is much improved, faster paced, and more fluid.<br /><br />I had fun with this game from beginning to end. As a longtime Dungeons and Dragons player, this game reminded me of some of the very brilliant city and town settings that I have played in years past, and perhaps that's why I liked it. I really enjoyed dealing with the factions and balancing the various personalities of the game.<br /><br />This game proves that you don't need to top your big bad ultimate villain from the previous game just to have a decent sequel. This game was not as immersive as it's predecessor, and the story is more linear, but it has a very high fun factor.<br /><br />If you like a wide open game world, like Skyrim or The Witcher, then you'll be disappointed. You spend a lot of time in town. Personally, I enjoyed this; but if you don't, and if you want a wide open game world, then this probably is not the game for you.",2015-08-31
US,50092635,R19FYNQWOU9OTJ,B004FYEZMQ,868275572,Mass Effect 3,Video Games,2,8,9,N,Y,Disappointing...,"This game has definitely the best game play of the 3, leading to awesome,  incredible missions,  and it has some oddball missions with gameplay that are totally unlike any of the other one. But there are four glaring faults that make this game terrible...<br />1) The story is just terrible.  I won't go further into detail as to why,  I'll just say after 2 games of setting this all up, you'll find yourself disappointed with the outcome. All those important decisions you made in the last 2 games become nothing more than a number in my next fault.<br />2) There's this thing called galactic readiness. It's a number.  The whole point of the game is to just get the number as high as you can. The only way to get it high is by performing some incredibly boring tasks. Including...<br />3) Multi-player. Which is just a boring,  repetitive horde mode. I'd say it would be a great new addition to the game,  but if you want to complete single player with any sort of positive outcome, you have to play multilayer.  A lot. Because of another number.  A percentage. It's the percent of the first number you try to get that you actually get.  The only way to raise it,  is to play multi-player. And it's impossible to get that number high enough without multi-player.<br />4) This goes back to story kind of, but the biggest flaw is that you really only get half of the single player. Everything in the games story is bare bones  A lot of it is included in about $50 of DLC. Like so much of the story is wrapped up in it,  characters even reference events that happen in the main game.  If you're going to sell me something,  sell me the whole thing.  Not part of it,  then all the other parts separately.",2015-08-31

The design borrows from the &#34;Perfect Shot&#34;, giving a realistic pistol grip feel, and borrows the design of the GonCon 3 Controller by adding a nunchuck holder for your nunchuck adapter. I love this little device as you you have everything you need right on the gun and can detach the nunchuck accessory/addon at any time. One main reason why i love this accessory is because I play a lot of rail shooters for the wii, mainly Ghost Squad. Apparently the people who ported the arcade game to the wii didn't have their heads on right as if you use the wii zapper accessory your trigger finger will be your left hand instead of your right with your secondary fire button being your right trigger finger. This upset me to know and and I thought that if all zapper games were like this, then there's gonna be a problem. I've looked at many pistol style accessories for the wii mote but the problem with those is that if you need to do something other than pull the trigger like in ghost squad, you'll have to reach up and around the barrel to push the buttons with your other hand. This was not only annoying but it also broke immersion which is something i'm big on.<br /><br />So how does this accessory fair? Well when I first got it I was finding it difficult to put together as mine didn't come with instructions, however after playing around with it I figured out how to set it all up. the way it's designed is that you'll have to flip up the rear site that is connected to a long plastic piece that runs down along the back of the grip and slip in the wiimote on top, once it's seated you can close the gun and have fun. if you wish to attach the nunchuck you'll have to connect the addon, put the nunchuck in the carry case and open up the rear sight again. At the very base of the handle you can see where the rear sight connect you can easily pull that whole piece out so that you can run the nunchuck cable all the way up the back of the handle and connect to the wiimote. Once you do that, snap the plastic piece back into place and close the rear sight and you're set. The power is now at your fingertips!<br /><br />The trigger responds well however the nunchuck add on feels a bit flimsy like it could break if gripped or jerks too hard or even dropped. Everything feels very similar to the GunCon 3 controller so if you've used that before, this will be a much welcomed accessory. All in all this is by far one of the better wiimote guns I've used and would greatly recommend it!",2015-08-31

US,27976830,R2ASLZ4CFHYD3O,B000B5PRMU,204335029,Prince of Persia (Sega CD),Video Games,4,3,3,N,Y,A New Coat of Paint,"After coming to many platforms, Jordan Mechner's magnum opus Prince of Persia arrived on the Sega CD in 1992.<br /><br />Prince of Persia tells the story of an unnamed Persian Kingdom whose Sultan has left to fight abroad. In his place, the evil vizier Jaffar takes control and plans to marry the Princess and kill the Sultan should he dare to return. However the Princess despises Jaffar and has fallen in love with a mysterious traveler. Knowing this young man will get in his way, Jaffar has him arrested and thrown into the deepest dungeon in the palace. He then gives the Princess an ultimatum, either marry Jaffar or die within the hour. Meanwhile, the young man has broken his bonds and must now race to the top of the palace to free the Princess before time runs out.<br /><br />Prince of Persia was ported to numerous other computers and consoles before this version, and while there are some distinguishing features, little has changed, however this is not necessarily a bad thing as Prince of Persia was and remains a fantastic platforming experience. Having been one of the first true attempts at realistic platforming, the controls definitely take considerable time to get used to. The game has you navigate a series of mazes with death traps and swordsmen at nearly every corner. The game places an emphasis on caution as running head on into any problem is a fast way to die. Despite this focus on taking things slowly, the ever present countdown is a constant reminder that you have to get moving. It is also important to note that, while you can retry a level as much as you want, starting over a level after death does not restart the countdown. Although the control may seem rough and difficult when you first play the game, after you are used to how the character moves and interacts with his surroundings the game becomes very fun.<br /><br />Most versions of this game tend to be the same, but there are a few that offer unique features. This version has some additions that add to the value and one that may turn some off. The key feature here is unique graphics. Instead of simply being a port of the Genesis version's graphics, the Sega CD version has it's own designs for the player and enemy sprites, as well as new variations on the backgrounds. however, although it's a nice touch, the graphics aren't quite as good as the Genesis version or as varied as the SNES version, which is a little disappointing for the Sega CD. Next is a feature very few versions of the game included, a full soundtrack. However, it is not very extensive. There are two tracks you will hear primarily throughout the game with a few fanfares here and there, but besides them there are a some tracks for the menus and cut scenes. And that brings us to the cut scenes. At the opening and ending of the game are cut scenes that tell the story. However, they have very little in the way of animation and the voice acting is what you'd expect from early nineties anime dubs. The one other feature that puts this version above the other console ports is the ability to save your game. Almost every console version requires passwords to keep your progress, but this version allows you to use the system's internal memory to save at the start of each level. This will allow you to shave off some time and beat the game as fast as you can.<br /><br />Overall, the package is fairly solid. It's not necessarily the preferred version of Prince of Persia, but it has enough to stand out among the numerous ports. If you have a Sega CD ans want to expand your collection a bit, it's worth getting.to the value and one that may turn some off. The key feature here is unique graphics.

Add in the Erin and Kirk segments that are semi-repetitive but still add a nice touch which the 2013 versions didn't have and I am liking this 2011 Road to Glory version the best of all the NCAA's I've played out of 05, 06, 08, and 13.

My real reason for purchasing this item over others was that I already had the same model charging station for my PS4 (and love it!). As for the xbox one model, the only thing holding your controller on the base is gravity. And as we all know, sometimes gravity can be a finicky beast. Also the batteries supplied do not contain as much of a charge as the official rechargeable batteries from Microsoft.<br /><br />All in all however, the device serves its purpose fine so long as you recognize it's faults. I have placed mine in an area that the controllers are not likely to get knocked off the charger but yet it's close enough for me to grab a spare controller if I need one.

Very unhappy that it took 3 painful hours to get to the welcome screen. Microsoft, is this cool? (Starting the console required a mandatory ~300 MB system update. I have a ~105 Mbps high-speed cable internet line from Comcast. Xbox one has a wired connection. Xbox is receiving internet speed between of 80 - 90 Mbps. Although the game file is downloading at about ~1 Mbps)<br /><br />Dear Microsoft Product Managers - here is a challenge for you. When a customer starts their Xbox One they should be able to begin using it in 60 seconds or less. If it takes several days to start using their game console then Steve Jobs is right about your sense of taste. And from my experience over the last 24 hours - a lack of respect for your customer's emotions.<br /><br />Folks, wish me happy birthday!",2015-08-30

But as far as saving space goes this thing is great. The system doesn't really lock into place, but so long as you don't fall into your tv stand (or wherever you keep your PS4) you should be okay. The fan is a little bit noisy if you're sitting in a quiet room, but if you're mid game or watching something on your Playstation it's not really that noticeable. However, they kindly help you with any issues you might have with that by adding a stop button that basically toggles the fans on and off. For the price, as just a stand and charger it's a no-brainer, while the fans seem to be just wishful thinking, it's something I'll let myself believe really works for everything else I am getting in this stand.",2015-08-30

Not a bid deal, you can still play for many hours (I'd say at least 6 on a full charge, maybe longer, I never counted).  Other than that, it looks, feels and functions just like the real thing and is identical in every way except it says &#34;P3&#34; on the center button instead of the official PS3 logo.  The joysticks have a nice rubber grip too like the real controller.  My 3 year old loves it and will only play with this controller now.  He has used it daily for about a week playing various LEGO games with no issues at all.  I don't know if the rumble/vibrate function works or not, as I have only used the controller myself very briefly, but for this price who cares.<br /><br />Another thing to note is that the controller will turn off automatically if you don't use it after a certain (and fairly short) period of time.  For example, if you are watching a movie on Netflix or something where you wouldn't be pushing buttons on the controller it will turn off, which is kind of annoying because you need to push the ps3 button to turn it back on before you can pause the movie, but overall this is a probably a good feature because it saves battery life and you can just fall asleep or walk away and it will turn off on its own.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this if you need an extra controller.  It is not worth paying over 3 times the price for an official Sony controller when the only real difference seems to be a longer battery life.  I was skeptical about buying a generic controller, but this one from USPRO works great so far and I'm very pleased.",2015-08-30

The mouse features two back and forward buttons on the left side of the device, as well as colorful lights that change every 4-5 seconds. I will go over some basic information regarding if this computer mouse is right for you.<br /><br />This product is for you if:<br />- You are looking for a USB wired, laser mouse.<br />- You don't mind the materials that the mouse consists of. For example, the &#34;outside shell&#34; of the mouse is most likely a type of plastic, although I'm not entirely sure.<br />- You wan't a light-up, color changing mouse.<br />- You plan on, or ensure, that you have a valid surface to utilize the mouse on. A preferred surface would be a manufactured mouse pad.<br /><br />This product is not for you if:<br />- You are seeking a durable and sturdy mouse.<br />- You are looking for a wireless mouse. (This product is wired)<br />- You want very basic features. This includes no extra buttons on the side or top, just the traditional left/right click buttons and scroll wheel.<br /><br />Although these are just things I recommend keeping in mind, one thing I wish to state is that this mouse is very fragile. If you plan on purchasing this product, please ensure that proper precautions are taken to help protect the device from braking or being damaged.<br /><br />Design:<br />Another aspect that makes this mouse interesting is the unique USB jack design. The frame that surrounds the actual USB jack(not the cord) appears as if it matches the theme of the mouse itself. In addition to that, the device appears both very smooth, but also maintains a slightly sharp and sleek design. The sides, corners, and top of the gaming mouse consist of white streaks by which allow the colorful lights to shine through. The light colors change every 4-5 seconds(as previously stated) and transition as follows: Red&#62;Green&#62;Orange&#62;Light Green&#62;White&#62;Blue&#62;Purple&#62;Pink, and the cycle continues. Please note that the color cycle as mentioned is not correct in terms of order.<br /><br />Durability & Materials:<br />Overall, the device looks and feels as if it could brake and suffer damage quite easily. This product isn't made of high end material, therefor I highly suggest that all buyers be cautious with the way they use this device and take proper care of it. If you are careful enough, this computer mouse will last a long time. If this device isn't treated properly, it may likely brake very soon.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />In a 4/5 rating, I would recommend this gaming mouse to all desktop/laptop users who want a few extra built-in features but also plan on keeping it in a safe place. As for consumers looking for a high end computer mouse, I wouldn't necessarily suggest this product to them. In conclusion, this PC gaming, USB wired, laser mouse is a good and out of the ordinary device.the cycle continues.

In conclusion, this PC gaming, USB wired, laser mouse is a good and out of the ordinary device.",2015-08-30

It's hollow and feels spiritless. Where GoW I, II, (and half of) III were soaked in story and oozed frustration, rage, sorrow, regret, loss, and sadness, &#34;Ascension&#34; is just simply going through the motions (never played the PSP games, although I'm sure they were better than this). You're Kratos. You rage. You smash people. Game end.<br />The enemies this time were the lamest I have ever seen. These are mostly the same enemies, but now they have become either &#34;elementals&#34; or use elements in their attacks. Also, why would the medusa's now change their look, when they were set -in stone- (ha, ha, yeah ok) before hand? Why give those insufferable Talos elemental attacks now, when this was a backstory? Why the hell is Ganesha in Greece and so pissed off at me?! Why is this green stiletto-wearing woman from Cirque du Freak spitting poison at me?!...AND what is that hand creature? Where is that in Greek mythology?<br />This game focused more on face-to-face combat with bosses, instead of the interesting and cool ways to take them down. So you're sitting there for up to thirty minutes to take down two people. Ridiculous. It's not a challenge, it's lazy writing and gaming.<br />Also, the narration in this game is barely if ever present. Kratos is unlike himself not yelling at things every other scene. With him silent, it really becomes half-hearted and something akin to just playing with toys.<br />The Fates are more annoying than they are daunting. The boss battles with them are again, some of the lamest I have seen in a long time. Half the time you want to just smack them away like an pesky fly, instead of &#34;...Oh holy...I HAVE TO FIGHT THAT?!&#34;<br />While this game does have beautiful scenery and you're fighting alongside some of the best hits of God of War's soundtrack, this is merely Kratos with so many colors he looks like he's at a techno rave. Kratos is given elements for his weapons, but they serve no real purpose except for minor gimmicks to temporarily halt the enemies. You don't even really need them, as most bosses only respond to non-magical attacks and just actual blade hits.<br />By the time the most awesome battle comes, the game is over in less than a few minutes. A giant and epic fight, reduced to a few quick button timed events. Tragic.<br />This is proof they only made this game for more money. Again, lazy writing and game-making.<br />Borrow it, don't buy it. The spirit is completely gone.its of God of War's soundtrack, this is merely Kratos with so many colors he looks like he's at a techno rave.

The game plays just as smooth as a console entry (minus getting off the board). The framerate occasionally hiccups a little bit but it definitely makes due with what it's given. The game has 7 levels, which seemed short but they're accessible in-game so you don't have to access the pause menu. There's no create-a-park so the 7 levels get stale after awhile, and the create-a-skater is bare bones which hurts the replay value. My biggest knock is the unbelievably short story mode which a seasoned fan could get through in a couple hours. They did add a classic mode as well which helps the replayability. One neat thing they added is creating your own deck and grafitti tags with the touchscreen and recording your own sounds that play when you bail, use a special, etc. (This is optional). Overall this is a surprisingly solid entry in the Tony Hawk series that stays true to the gameplay we're used to on consoles. For the greatest portable Tony Hawk, play Tony Hawk's Underground 2 Remix on PSP. If DS or 3DS is your only option, buy this one as it's the best Tony Hawk game for the systems.",2015-08-30

On the box it says to use a hard drive with 2TB or less because the firmware won't support anything bigger than 2TB it will support up to a 4TB SSD the only thing is you can't use rest mode at least until they update the firmware. Before you turn on your PS4 to use the new drive you need to get a flash drive with 1GB of storage or greater go online to www.playstaion.com and download the latest software update and then put your PS4 into safe mode to do that hold down the power button on the system until you hear two beeps once in safe mode put the flash drive into one of the slots on the console then on the menu that comes up select the last option this will erase everything that you have done its worth it in the end re initialize the system set it all up again the way you had it,2015-08-30

Bass is incredible and it's nice having the separate dials for sound and game/chat volume balance.

Plug in your controller via the usb cable and keep the headset just plugged into the 3.5 jack on the adapter. They work on pc flawlessly.<br /><br />As for the sound, I prefer them over the px21 earforces that broke on me, as well as the x11's that broke. These are much sturdier, physically, and you can't beat that they're wireless. If they do for some reason have some internal wiring probs, pdp makes it easy on you by enabling easy disassembling.

As a result, my review is coming from a somewhat biased place, since any case was going to have to work really hard to do its job.<br /><br />The case itself fits nicely, though I had to take a few minutes to figure out how to snap it on. If you have your DS open too much or too little, you can't get this on or off. It's a decent clear, so the colour isn't overly compromised, which I do like. It's sturdy enough that I don't feel like it'll have a problem protecting my system, although it's not padded so a decent impact would still break the machine.<br /><br />However, I find it doesn't do a fantastic job of keeping the dust and grime out, by any means. Scratches, yes. Spills, yes. I still find myself having to take off the case to clean it once in a while because my DS starts to get a lot of little particles hanging out under the plastic protector.

Not exactly. As the game begins the tension builds. 8 characters in a more like mansion then cabin but it's really cool and isolated. Yo u have the characters you can't stand with their cocky attitudes then the ones you really like. Sweet and pleasant. Once you are finally introduced to the next year's characters going to the cabin after the tragic accident the year before, in honor of them they return. The character are all introduced as who they really are, compassionate, smart or egotistical and cocky. Not it the males but females as well. Then you get on with the game and your in this freaky office that's with a psychiatrist , I think, that's if he's real. But he sort of guides you thru each chapter telling you what a shifty  job you've  done to date or good job. Then you get a recap before you move on. As you decide die the fate of each character , thinking your really are controlling it which is really not the case cause it's very unpredictable. It reminds me of the freaky dude from the SAW movie talking and giving you a choice, the psychiatrist is a actor I can't quite remember his mane but you'll no. So between. The saw movie and this guy it's kind cool. Your playing threw a movie that's all.not much action game play but very interesting. If I scared easily I'd have been honestly s a red but I don't so I wasn't. It is freaky and bloody. It's a cool game and I'm glad I preordered. I.played it almost from the middle Ute I put it in about 8 pm til 2 am then find pushed up in the am after about 2  more hrs. So you get about 8 to 9 hrs depending on you . The decisions aren't always easy and like I said not what they seem. The storyline is freaky and scary but good it's like playing threw a movie that you semi control.<br />I see me playing this game multiple times trying to see what different outcomes I get.<br />Yes it like watching a killer movie like Halloween and saying to the character 'hoe dumb are you ,he's going to find you' this time your making the the decisions and kicking yourself for making the wrong move.<br />Basically the totems and the butterfly effect and you  are what controls the fate of all of them.

I have a ~105 Mbps high-speed cable internet line from Comcast. Xbox one has a wired connection. Xbox is receiving internet speed between of 80 - 90 Mbps. Although the game file is downloading at about ~1 Mbps)<br /><br />Dear Microsoft Product Managers, here is a challenge for you. When a customer starts their Xbox One they should be able to begin using it in 60 seconds or less. If it takes several days to start using their game console then Steve Jobs is right about your sense of taste. And from my experience over the last 24 hours - a lack of respect for your customer's emotions.<br /><br />Folks, wish me happy birthday!",2015-08-30

It's far better than most. The six button layout is excellent for Street Fighters V. The button size and placement are nice and feels better than the Dualshock 4. There're really only two things I can complain about this pad. 1. No audio port for headphone/mic. Sure you can use one of those Sony's wireless headphone for the PS4. But it would be nice to have an audio/headphone port for some mic options. 2. The D-Pad, the D-Pad is fine and works as well as the DualShock 4 but the fact that it can rotate lead me to believe that it will be a problem later on. And it feels a little flimsy and cheap like it's about to fall off.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this if you're looking for a fight pad or just doesn't have the money for a fight stick. This is clearly the best fight pad for PS4 and PC currently.",2015-08-30

US,6988295,R3LR7SGEWOHTFT,B00XMQBA62,759781829,Vita Sword Art Online Lost Songs (English subtitles),Video Games,2,2,2,N,Y,Fanboys beware this review.,"If you are an avid fan of the TV series, or just a casual gamer looking for a JRPG, I would not recommend this game. Before all the fanboys go insane here is a simple list of both Pros AND Cons of Lost Song.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Amazing graphics that utilizes the Vita's systems perfectly<br />Flight! The flight ability in this game is unparalleled in any other game I have ever played.<br />Co-op. Going online and questing with friends or strangers is a few buttons away and hours of fun.<br />Tons of characters to choose from to play as with a customizable party.<br />A personal pro of mine is that the game is somewhat long, more than just a 4 hour campaign then multiplayer grinding. This game can take a serious chunk of your time to complete and get all the trophies for which in my opinion makes a game worth it.<br />Overall an exciting adventure into one of the worlds that I had watched some of my favorite characters diving into (no pun intended).<br /><br />Cons:<br />Broken aggro<br />No sense of accomplishment from beating powerful bosses<br />0 companion commands/orders<br />Pathetic number of skills<br />Bosses are almost unblock-able, spam the same attacks (dragons should not jump on me every 3 seconds stun locking my whole party), and have an overkill amount of hp/def that needlessly prolongs the battle<br />Awkward and unhelpful map/minimap<br />No sense of deepening character relationships<br />Clumsy item inventory/equip screens<br />Terrible camera angles<br />Repetitive dungeons. There is a point where re-using the EXACT COPY of a tile-set should be illegal<br />The overall plot is not clear because the subplots are given too much importance, weakening the overall storytelling ability of the game.<br />ENEMY RESPAWN RATE. I cannot tell you how many times I left a room, re-entered it with no loading screens in between and end up fighting the same mobs. The RR makes this game an eternal grind fest.<br />The leveling system feels so unrewarding and is broken when compared to the damage/level increases of enemy mobs.<br />Magic targeting needs vast amounts of improvement.<br />Silica is in this game.<br />Restricting classes to only a partial number of an already limited number of weapons is frankly annoying.<br />Enemy aggro is one of the worst parts of this game that take all modern conventions of how aggro works and ignores them, leaving players baffled as to why their healer 3 rooms away is being targeted by the mini-boss instead of your two tanks who are sitting in front of it whacking away at its face.<br />Enemies can dodge repeatedly out of the way of sword skills, whose range is pathetically small and is a locked animation.<br />Indoor enemies can fly, indoor players can't. Indoor enemies can fly over the players attacks. Basically, indoor battles are a bunch of jumping around using the stupid jump attack.<br />Rain is in this game.<br />The block cool down is far to long to be of any use other than protecting your character from a deadly blow once or twice a battle. This feature is completely useless for sustained blocks/counters.<br />Seven is in this game.<br />Stop with the lolis already, we get it japan, you like your lolis, please stop tormenting the rest of the world with your weird fetish. This may just be an opinion that I and I alone hold, but when i'm trying to play an RPG and slay some dragons and rock demons, i'd prefer if a 12 year old did not keep trying to get in to my main character's already questionably large harem.<br />Create your own character! Awesome! Except..its a generic bland character with a total of about 15 options that range from mildly racist to probably racist.<br />Getting struck while in the air means you fall to the ground, no matter the height, no matter the damage that was dealt. This just prolongs battles and makes an awkward lull in combat.<br /><br />Well, that was a fun little list wasn't it? Overall, take this game as it is, a byproduct of the massive amount of attention and adoration gained from SAO the series. If you seriously want a good JRPG that is not only a product of your favorite fantasy world but is also a GOOD GAME, check out SAO: Hollow Fragment for the PS Vita or I think it is SAO: Re: Hollow Fragment for the PS4. Basically, everything Lost Song should have been but without the graphics quality or clear English translations. If you enjoyed my commentary please leave a thumbs up, if I missed anything or if you think there was something that does not match with the reality of the game, feel free to leave a comment.",2015-08-30

This is my favorite fighting game on the PS4. The sexiness is a major major plus. But I think it does try to be semi tasteful. The core gameplay is fantastic, as you would expect from a DOA game. You have lots of stuff to unlock, lots of modes to play, lots of characters.<br /><br />Here is one gripe. How many iterations of DOA5 has there been? Plus, Ultimate, then Last Round. Same kinda applies with Street Fighter IV. Lots of versions that add on to the other. But on Last Round, I made the mistake in assuming that all dlc would be included, which it should have been, if it's the final version. And it's painful to scroll through the costumes, and see that there are tons of costumes that are locked because of dlc. It's a horrible teaser. Everytime you play the game, it shoves the costumes in your face and says 'nah nah you don't have this, neaner neaner'. I would have rather it shown me just what I have, and if I wish to purchase more, I would just go on my PSN store.<br /><br />The graphics are superb. Still has last gen roots, but its shiny and looks great. I love the rock paper scissors fighting dynamic. It's the first fighting game I played where I feel like I'm not just button mashing. I love the game, I wish I could give it a 5 star. From a gameplay point of view, it's definitely a 5 star. But that dlc thing really bothers me. Again, I'm fine with dlc, that's just how games are nowadays, but to scroll through the costume options and always be reminded that you don't have these costumes is really cruel. Especially when I paid top dollar for supposed the ultimate version of the game.",2015-08-30

US,14473704,R2PBPIPJMPHXVH,B002BS47JE,449719506,Wii Fit Plus,Video Games,5,2,2,N,Y,Still Loving It after all these years!,"I purchased the &#34;old&#34; Wii Fit in 2009 and upgraded (happily) to the Wii Fit Plus in 2010.  I was able to really build strength, etc., etc., along with having fun, especially with the Balance Games and Activities, which I used to reward myself.  Because of room restrictions in my home, I found myself not using the program after about a year.  I recently began using it again (now have room availability) and have to say that I'd forgotten how much FUN this program is, especially used in conjunction with other types of exercise.  I found adding in a half hour to hour workout 2 to 3 times a week really helped me to drop some pounds and firm up considerably. The reason I returned to Wii Fit Plus was for the Yoga poses in particular, which I wanted to help strengthen my hip in order to avoid need for hip replacement.  In 6 weeks, I found I had significantly expanded range of motion, less pain (I also walk 5 miles a day), and much greater flexibility, strengh, balance in my lower body.  So I feel my re-adding it into my routines has made a great difference!  I love the fact I can select my own exercises and set them up in order as desired.",2015-08-30

In reality, they hold 22 DS/3DS cartridges, with one of the cartridge sections reserved - on both sides - for SD or Micro SD cards. The way it stands, I'm surprised they didn't call it 26-in-1 since you can technically pack two micro SDs, two SDs, and 22 game cartridges in there... since they already confused you anyway.<br /><br />I bought these expecting 24 cartridge slots, so I was already a little disappointed when I realised I couldn't put them all in that way. HOWEVER, they do work... decently for what they're intended to do.<br /><br />The plastic is decently thick and durable, which in this case is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, you don't feel like you'll break anything just by dropping the case. On the other hand... the plastic tabs that hold the games in place are also fairly thick, so sometimes I feel like I'm going to break my *cartridge* trying to wrest it from the case's fiendish grip. Other times, the games just fall out almost on their own...<br /><br />I believe it was said in another review, as well: these cases have tab slots for you to put in 3DS games, but the tabs are flipped from one side to the other. So if you have a game on the top side of the case with its label facing up, and a game on the opposite side, that label will be upside down. There's literally no other way to put it in the case. It doesn't affect DS games since they don't need that extra little slot.<br /><br />The games themselves sit in a little case that, like the hollow of a traditional game case, is just a tiny bit taller than the game. HOWEVER, since there are no moving parts (like in DS cases where you can push your cartridge gently against the tabs to compress them and pull it out), you're basically stuck trying to slide your fingernail under the cartridge and yank it out of the tabs... which, as I said, are pretty thick and sturdy. Your game cartridge will NOT feel nearly so sturdy doing this, sometimes.<br /><br />The slots to hold styluses are just that - little slots between the two sections to hold the stylus. They work fine, but you won't be able to fit anything larger than a traditional stylus (one that you could house in your DS itself) into it. There's nothing else to really say about that.s, sometimes.<br /><br />The slots to hold styluses are just that - little slots between the two sections to hold the stylus.

There were no air bubbles, and it looks GREAT. Plus it seems to be made from superior quality, and not as thin as the last one.<br /><br />It's been a few days, and he's been playing it a lot. So far there are no bubble pockets forming from the heating, and it still looks as cool as it did on the first day. No edges have come up and it really adds character to what comes as a plain old gaming console. The controller decals went on just as well. Needless to say, he adores the graphics. He was so happy to see it.<br /><br />I would highly recommend.<br /><br />I received this product at a DISCOUNT in exchange for my honest review. This is my personal experience with this product, and reflects my own opinion as it would be if I had paid full price for it.",2015-08-30

(Update)","Very weak fan. System feels hotter than before just running netflix. Only use aside from a stand is to charge two controllers and the extra hubs. If you want that I recommend one that isn't a vertical stand and doesn't restrict airflow in to the system.<br /><br />*UPDATE<br />Ok, so I decided to use it for about 3 months...<br /><br />It was fine, a little noisy at first but tolerable. I would say after a month and 3/4 in the noise got louder, which scared me because I thought it was the system. The sound when I disconnected it was golden silence, that's how annoying it was. I use Netflix a lot and believe me when I say it was annoying hearing a mini vacuum while watching Netflix or just on standby/rest mode. After that I only used it while gaming, hoping it would go back to the way it used to sound when I first got it. It didn't workout as planned.<br /><br />So now its laying on top of my flat system being used as a charging/hub station. I recommend that.....yeah just that....unless you like the sound of hand held vaccuums and restricting outwards airflow while keeping the fan off. -gasp for air-",2015-08-30

The matte silver finish on the console and controller is what drew me in. Do not get me wrong, I loved the original black console, but the fact of the matter is that the gloss black HDD cover is prone to scratching. Big time. Even the slightest wipe from a microfiber cloth causes scratches. I do not understand why Sony chose to implement this type of material when they removed it completely from the PS3 slim. It is like taking a step backwards in innovation. Why Sony, why??? So in a couple of years down the road I would have to purchase a PS4 slim? Most likely.<br /><br />The Batman PS4 eliminates this problem and is also part of the reason why I decided to purchase this console even though I had the original black PS4. Like the consoled itself, the controller does not have any gloss. It is quite similar to the likes of the urban camo controller in terms of finish.<br /><br />For the fans who love Batman this is a must. For those who cannot stand the gloss on the original black PS4 the collector edition PS4 seems to be one alternative.<br /><br />Aside from the color the Batman PS4 is exactly the same as the original with updated internals that functions more or less as the original. Even though I paid a premium of approximately $50 for the color I am content with my purchase. It is a very stylish and classy PS4 befitting any household.",2015-08-30

It looks great and works pretty well, too. My biggest complaint is that I am unable to control my TV's volume with the remote. I own a Vizio M-Series TV and all other CEC functions work fine. I can turn on my TV by powering on the Shield, it automatically selects the correct input, and I can even control the Shield with my TV remote. But for whatever reason, it will not control my TV's volume via CEC. This is a pretty big deal for me and it's why I am rating it at 2 stars. This means I need to use another remote to control my audio system. I've been communicating with Nvidia support this past week, but there hasn't been a resolution yet (and I can't say their support is all that great either). This may just be a compatibiltly issue with the TV that I own, but either way, it's a big disappointment for me.  Some other minor issues I have: - Fairly big response delay at certain times. I think the remote must go to sleep or something because if you haven't used the remote for a while and then press a button, sometimes the response can take up to a full second. After that first response, all further actions are pretty much instant. - I wish I could turn my TV off with the remote. There doesn't seem to be support for this. - Too expensive. I got mine on sale for half off. I don't think I'd ever recommend it at $50 especially since it can't replace all other remotes.  EDIT: They finally came out with an update recently that addressed the CEC issues. It is now working as expected for my setup. It only took them about 7 months from the time I originally opened up a ticket with their support staff (and many more before me had as well).",2015-08-30

I purchased this headset back in December 2013 (it'll almost be two years) and I have to say, it is absolutely fantastic! Aside from being able to immerse myself into my gaming experience, I can also keep all the loud noises from the game to myself so I don't bother my family.<br />Alright, so here's a couple of things:<br />-There are 3 controls on the headset: Game Volume, Chat Volume, Mic (MUTE/ON). To use the chat volume and the Mic, you have to plug in the cord (that's part of the headset) into your controller jack. This is obvious but I thought I'd list it anyways.<br />-The noise amplification works great! 'Great' is an understatement. Anyways, you seriously feel like you're in the game! You just become so immersed in the atmosphere of your game and forget that you're just some dude or dudette sitting in front of a TV with a gaming headset on. NOTE: This headset is capable of bursting your eardrums if you decide to play with MAX volume on the headset, plus the volume control settings of whatever game you're playing. So do be careful with how you select the volume levels.<br />-The cord is really long, which is convenient so you don't have to play right IN FRONT of your TV.<br />-The microphone works fine. The cool thing is that you can slightly hear yourself talking in the headset, so you know you're not being unnecessarily loud.<br />I would say my only complaint is the styrofoam piece where the headset rests on your head.

For many years, I was a 2K guy.  Unfortunately, we all know what happened there.  So, when I decided to get a baseball game I turned to The Show. The graphics deserve an &#34;A&#34;. I was pleasantly surprised by the overall graphics. The players, even the managers actually look like the real deal.  The stadiums look legit.  What really sells it for me is the detail.  Every player has their unique stance or wind up.  Even down to their follow thru on their swing is spot on.  The players movement is extremely fluid, and it doesn't feel fake. Overall, the graphics are first rate.  As far as the gameplay, it feels good. It's smooth, and doesn't feel jerky.  The difficulty is just right.  The batting can be challenging, but not difficult.  The pitching is easy to figure out, and makes you really earn your outs.  I haven't played online yet so I can't comment there.  As far as franchise goes its good stuff.  Still has create a player which is cool, but my only gripe about the game is in the difficulty trying to find the player once you create him.  Still, its a very minor inconvenience and the player can be found. All in all, if you're  looking for a good baseball game, don't hesitate to turn to The Show.",2015-08-30

The wait time for loading is constant, from anything as pausing the game to check the map to gaining new intel on enemy captains. And the wait time itself is atrocious. It takes forever for anything to load. As well, the game has a lot of difficulty rendering its own pieces and environments. When you pause, for example, and it shows an enemy captain, it takes the game a few moments as it loads the character layer by layer (so first you have the basic outline, then some armor, then some more armor, then some new color shades, etc). It does this with the  overworld map, too, especially at night. You take a step one direction and the ground appears very bright in color (as far as the camera can see). Take a step in another direction and suddenly everything is dark again. There are lots and lots of little bugs like this that really should have been worked out before release. It makes for a very poor gaming experience (especially the never-ending load time).<br />It is a fun game and all, but it could be so much better just with basic fixes.",2015-08-30

In fact you really don't even get to do a quick pick of what you would have done in past choices either as the game just randomly rolls a series of choices for you leaving some things awkward for you in the game if that's not the kind of choices you would usually wanna roll with or flat out detrimental to your ability to pick one faction over another and keep them at their highest war assets point, case in point, the game decided for me in the past I'd basically not helped the Krogan one bit what so ever, so by siding with them over the salarians in the game I had just handicapped myself to a small degree in my overall war assets stuff because my krogan faction would never be able to realize its full point amount and would be hampered by negative things.  It was at that point I really just stopped playing this on my Wii U and went back to playing it on my ps3 and 360.  For a game about making your choices matter and count, it really just falls short of that heavily in this version, and with no DLC to speak of available I'd advise playing this on another system if you can unless you just want a good horde/zombie mode game for online play for your Wii U, then by all means give this a go as I love the multiplayer across all three versions.",2015-08-30

I've played other great survival-horror games out there like Amnesia and Outlast and this game takes a place next to them as one of the best survival-horror game. Not going to lie here, you will die a lot in this game if you are not careful. I've already completed the game twice now. My second time on Nightmare mode and boy did it prove to be VERY difficult. This game is very stealth heavy and slow-paced. If you don't have the patience, then you're going to have a rough time playing this game. Now onto the pros and cons I have about this game.<br /><br />Good:<br />+ Alien behavior is completely unpredictable and makes the experience challenging.<br />+ Great atmosphere and level design makes for immersive and tense gameplay.<br />+ Superb soundtrack. The music seems to play at the right moment to make you tense. Play with a good headset for the best experience. Also helps with pinpointing where the Alien is.<br />+ Voice acting is good. A lot of people seem to disagree from the reviews I've read.<br />+ Fun 'hacking' puzzles. All puzzles will be in real-time so watch your back before doing one or else you'll be a sitting duck if the Alien happens to see you.<br />+ A number of useful items to craft and weapons at your disposal. The Flamethrower will be your best friend when you get it.<br />+ Survival Mode adds bit more gameplay after you've completed the main story.<br />+ The Nostromo Edition had The Crew Expendable DLC. It's very short but interesting mission.<br />+ Game is about 15 hours long.<br /><br />Bad<br />- First thing I noticed were choppy scenes and some bad lip and sound sync. There's also bad sound sync throughout the game.<br />- Visuals are... meh. I was able to play the PC version at a friend's house and even on low settings, it looked far better than the PS3 version. The Devs probably had to tweak the settings way down for it to run on the PS3.<br />- I know it's how the devs made it to be but the Alien is ALWAYS in your area and always come searching in a room you are hiding in. Gets annoying when I'm literally hiding in a locker for a good couple of minutes because it keeps coming back.<br />- A few encounters with the Alien and you'll know the sound it makes when it jumps up into or down from a vent but there are times when it'll just magically appear around the corner without making any of those noises and kill you. Kinda BS if you ask me. It did this a couple of time on me.<br />- Sometimes you'll see a random weapon floating around lol<br />- A lot of back tracking during the second-half of the game.<br />- Crouching Simulator. lol I wished the crouching speed was a little bit faster since you'll spend most of the game doing so.<br />- Lack of Auto-save will have you doing an objective over if you keep dying. So save every chance you get. It will auto-save during some moments in the game though.<br />- Crafting UI feels awkward when choosing a component to commit to an item.<br />- Probably the worst thing about this game were the drops in frame rate. It was really headache inducing for me. The game will stutter when you go to a new area or when there's a lot of things happening on the screen.<br /><br />My experience with the PS3 verson was... not so great at times but for the most part it played well.  I still really enjoyed playing it despite the cons I've listed. If you can, I'd say get the PS4 version. If you don't have a PS4 then go ahead and get the PS3 version if you're a person who doesn't care about graphics./>- I know it's how the devs made it to be but the Alien is ALWAYS in your area and always come searching in a room you are hiding in.

I'm sure it would be nice if you use it on other consoles/laptop/mobile.  I believe this issue is due to Sony trying to only sell their products and limiting consumer choice.  However, Gioteck should not market it as PS4 compatible on the box when it isn't either.  I am returning it to buy a Sony approved headset.

This was due to time restrain and the port simply not working as well to Xbox one but the way I see it it was not only an opportunity for Black tusk to experiment as well as measure sales but it simply gave them the opportunity to get used to the essence of what makes a Gears game a Gears game; this is where it all started after all.  The graphics and story are revamped give both newcomers a beautiful first time experience and the veterans, like me, the nostalgia we hoped for. The game is absolutely amazing in comparison and for those who don't agree.... They've gotta be blind or relying on memory (try gears 1 for Xbox 360 its like $5) I cant make it past the 1st chapter even if you paid me. I simply don't have enough patience for the outdated mechanics. However I found myself walking though gears UE analyzing the graphics in ever chapter, amazed instead of running through and even attempting to wallbouce since the speed was now fast enough to consider it.  Inn every chapter I noticed the scene was always kept true to gow1 but updated to have more of an effect in rage of emotions due to a now noticeable blood shed, light coming in on a garden, or the characters reacting to someone's death who was before disregarded and unimportant and It hurts ... Haha however the big con I noticed was the AI...they're broken and seem to have been doing drugs since they run into walls, take cover on the wrong walls keeping themselves exposed, and occasionally having a dance off which could cause single players a major issue and I find it unforgivable to have such a massive issue left un-addressed.  Multiplayer wise.... It's a brutal as it's ever been and not for everyone. You won't be able to pick it up as easily as a call out duty game or halo. People playing this game are unforgiving and its best to play alongside someone else or a team if youre new lol.  People will constantly complain about the gnasher accuracy (as always) , speed, and power weapon rages and I doubt this will ever change but I have to say this is an enjoyable multiplayer in comparison to GOWJ and I would regard it almost as highly as GOW3. There are kinks that need to be worked out but nothing I noticed that couldn't be patched in later and it shouldn't take 1000 patched like with destiny or the, still broken halo mcc; this works. Lol my personal issue with the game is not having surround sound but, correct me if I'm wrong, this seems to be a feature mostly unsupported by Xbox one and not just the game in general.   If you buy this and you're new, please, please, please, play the campaign first and get used to the mechanics since multiplayer may turn you off from the game. It's a shark tank but it's the rush you get once you've gotten used to it that will keep some of us up until 7am playing -it may  take some brutal beatings before you begin to enjoy it.

Honestly, I'm not pro gamer, and just wanted something that plays nice with a mix of games (Destiny, Bloodborne, etc). I average maybe 1-2hrs on weekdays, and more on weekends. What I've started to notice is that my thumbstick covers have started to kind of deform around my thumbsticks, changing from their initial orientation and becoming kind of lob-sided in shape. I also can tell I'm slowly starting to wear down the actual gecko shaped texture of the grip making them progressively less grippy.

At this time it's the only Cave game available for the PS3, everything else is on the Xbox 360. I'd invest in that if I were you. Also, there is a slight delay in movements while playing this game. While it isn't a deal breaker, this game requires memorization and good reaction speeds on the part of the player. Having my ship move slower than I can react is definitely annoying at times.

So u have to slow urself down alotttt. But it does a decent job at what it's supposed to do which is type faster and easier than using a in game keyboard like when u play a mmo such as final fantasy 14 or when using the Internet on the ps4.

Bungie has no idea on how to make a MMO. Plus 500 million dollar budget on this poor quality game. Its not even fun when you're playing with other people. The only good thing about the game is the music and visuals.<br /><br /> I did not find this fun because I had experience playing other MMOs. I think a lot of people enjoy this game because its their first MMO, and they don't have anything to compare Destiny to other relate able MMO games. That's completely understandable and hey if you have fun then that's cool.<br /><br />I recommend this game to people who never played a MMO, who don't care about story, or a serious bungie fan. But if you're like me that craves a good story in games and have experience playing MMOs then this game is not for you.",2015-08-29

At least in Tomb Raider Definitive Edition, you have options on how to defeat enemies. Lara's movements are multi planar, but Marius only moves 1 way. Ryse has &#34;combat&#34; button mashing, but you have to do it the same way each time practically against every enemy you face. The graphics of course are the high point of this game (just like 99% of current video games), with a story that is as transparent and 1 dimensional as water. The boss battles are EXCEPTIONALLY annoying. Be prepared to &#34;be defeated&#34; in every section of this game.

The action is tense, the maps look cool, and the enemies are tough without being overwhelming, and even when they roll over you, the game never feels cheap. You can revive yourself as long as you are still able to crawl, a teammate can expedite the process, and if you do die, your teammates can set a beacon that revives you. There are a ton of upgrades to your weapons, special abilities (which take the form of calling in ammo, special equipment, ally revives, etc...), and so on. There are two different vehicles your team can pile into that are also armed. The missions make sense.<br />Anyway, this twin stick squad shooter basically gets everything right.

US,50957321,R2UCFZPYK5OQ9S,B00XO7AK1U,89917079,NVIDIA SHIELD Pro (2015),Video Games,2,4,7,N,Y,"falls so short in so many ways, its impossible to recommend.","i highly anticipated the SATV, and put in my pre-order the instant it went on sale... however, after having used it for a little more than 6 weeks, i find i cant recommend it to anyone at this time.<br /><br />i was looking for the shield to do two things: replace my roku for video content, and allow me to stream my pc games to my living room tv... and while the SATV does do both things, it does neither of them well, and is a pretty huge disappointment.<br /><br />the selection of video content is shockingly poor. if all you use is netflix, then you will be happy with the shield, but past that your choices are severely limited. no amazon instant video, no vudu, no hbo, not much of anything. netflix, and google play video. thats about it. supposedly, vudu and hbo are coming 'soon' but who knows when that will be? and it is my understanding that amazon instant video will likely NEVER come to the android tv platform. why? because amazon, thats why. which also makes me rage, but is an entirely different issue unrelated to the shield.<br /><br />as for game streaming... where do i begin? i have had a love/hate relationship with nvidia's gamestream product for years, since i got the first shield portable when it came out. i had hoped that nvidia would correct some of its many, many, many deficiencies with the SATV... but no. when it works, it is fantastic. WHEN it works. gamestream has suffered multi-day outages of its host discovery servers, and continues to do so on a regular basis. generally, every 3-4 weeks you can expect it to cut out for 2-5 days at a time. because of shockingly poor decisions on nvidia's part, this host discovery is required to stream EVEN when the shield and the host pc are on the SAME WIRED NETWORK. and even when you are able to get connected to your host pc, gamestreaming is plagued with problems: their controller emulation is woefully flawed, you can expect it to work for about 1 game in 5, because of the technical implementation. generally, you can expect most (but not all) big-budget games to look for a controller in the 'right' way that nvidia supports... otherwise, you are out of luck. this can be worked around to some extent with third-party tools, but when you consider competing products like kino console are able to provide a controller emulation layer that works 100% of the time, nvidia's inability (or refusal) to get this right is inexcusable.<br /><br />also, if you have a projection hdtv, like a dlp set, i hope you can live with having about 7% of your screen cut off on every edge, because the SATV has absolutely NO overscan correction. again, every other android-based tv device i have played with (and there have been many) includes overscan correction in its settings (including googles own android tv device), and it beggars belief that nvidia didnt include this and continues to refuse to add it.<br /><br />then there are all the other issues like the SATV being sorely lacking in audio and video codec support, having many performance glitches in the pro model owing to, evidently, poor hard drives requiring RMA, finicky peripheral connection, poor external media support, on and on it goes.<br /><br />the SATV has potential to be a great media box. someday. assuming nvidia gives it the support it needs... but if youve had nvidia android products in the past, you know how likely that is (hint: not likely at all)...<br /><br />all things considered, give this a pass. get a roku 3, and a steam link when they come out.",2015-08-29

The controls are easy to use and game play isn't turn based instead you have materia shaped icons and you scroll between them for things like basic attack, magic, positions ect.

The game runs very smoothly. It looks like a home console release. The graphics are really impressive given what they had to work with. I got this game today, so I'll be updating when anything new comes up, but otherwise, the main part of the review will be right here.<br /><br />Gameplay: The gameplay is great. There really isn't much else to say. You beat up famous Nintendo characters, and it is some of the best fun you'll have on the 3DS. The characters play at a smooth 60fps, it really amazes me. If you get an Assist Trophy, or throw a Pokeball, the character that comes out of it will only be doing their animations at 30 frames per second. However, you really don't notice all that much, it's not like they are there for very long anyways. I believe you can customize the controls, but they are pretty much perfect as is, aside from one issue. You cannot use the d-pad to move, you can only use the circle pad. I am a d-pad kind of person when it comes to games of the fighting variety, so this is a negative for me. The d-pad is used for taunts instead.<br /><br />Story: There isn't one, much to my disappointment. I really enjoyed the Subspace Emissary of Brawl, at least what I played of it. It would be a HUGE plus if they had a story on this iteration of Smash, but that is sadly not the case. There is a lot of potential, especially with all of these new characters that have been added. This is probably three quarters of a star taken away, if not more.<br /><br />Other Modes: Normal Smash. You just fight. It sounds really boring, but just thinking about it makes me want to get off the computer, pop the cartridge in the slot and play it before finishing the review. There's a multiplayer option, but I'll get into that a bit later. There is Smash run, which is fun but a bit hard. You go around a dungeon thingy and collect powerups, then after 3 minutes you fight using those power ups. It is quite fun, and is exclusive to the 3DS version, if I am not mistaken. There is classic mode, where you choose a character and fight some pre selected enemies until you get to the final boss. Those can be difficult as well. There are a few other modes, but there are too many to get into.<br /><br />Wii U: I believe you can use the 3DS as a controller on the Wii U version of the game, but I don't own a Wii I, so I can't say anything about this.<br /><br />Streetpass: There is Streetpass functionality for this game, but I have yet to encounter a fellow Smasher on the street.,<br /><br />Online: This is where problems are...existent. There are 2 main modes: For Glory and For Fun. For Glory is where your battle stats are recorded and put in a leaderboard and all that. No items or anything like that. For Fun is just like normal Smash, but it is with online players. Smash Run can be played with LOCAL multiplayer, meaning somebody close by who also owns a copy of the game.  I only played For Fun, and boy was it hard. Not because of the fellow players and their skills, because of the RIDICULOUS lag. The lag can range from playable to 'turn the game off' bad. My first match was not possible to play. It took 30 seconds for any input I made to actually register. The worst part is that the other players seemed fine, and as a result I ended up getting ganged up on. The frames per second were so low, it looked like the world's oldest turtle was doing a slideshow of pictures from the game. The other matches were playable, but it still wasn't possible to win. It took 2 to 3 seconds for input to register, and the frames were tolerable except for a little freezing. But 2 to 3 second input lag is not acceptable when it comes to a fast paced game like Super Smash Bros. My point is: local multiplayer with somebody right next to you, you get the Wii U version.<br /><br />In short, the game is very very fun, and it is amazing what Nintendo was able to do with such limited hardware. Butfor online matches, it would be best to look at the Wii U version of the game. And there's no story mode.for online matches, it would be best to look at the Wii U version of the game.

Glad I ignored it... Is it leaps and bounds over last year’s Madden? No. But, in my opinion, Madden 15 was a pretty solid game. Can’t say I’ve had any of the freezing or bugs others have seen in this version– and even if there are those issues, new updates will fix them… I didn’t notice any excess loading times like other reviewers suggested.<br /><br />Enhancements & Updates:<br />-Obviously, like every year, updated rosters including 2 new high profile starting rookie QBs this year<br />-New extra point rule being farther out<br />-Better passing, including a ‘touch pass’ that gets it over the LBs, but under the safeties. Also, a ‘low to the ground pass’ and a ‘shoulder pass’. Yeah, you could ‘kind of’ do it in last year’s edition (not the touch pass over the middle so much), but it feels better this year’s update.<br />-No huddle situations aren’t as ‘rushed’ for the defense where you’re on the brink of off-sides every time - like it was last year<br />-Better catching options: ‘Catch and Run’, ‘Catch and Go Down’ which helps in traffic, and ‘Aggressive / Acrobatic Catch’ (which by the way has excellent animations whether you catch the ball or not). I thought this sounded like a useless gimmick at first, but after playing it, I like it.<br />-Enhanced after play animations: you don’t have players flopping around and falling down like idiots after the play like in last year’s edition. Also, more realistic look in the way players are tackled and piled on top of each other in gang tackles.<br />-Player / Coaches faces and bodies look more realistic<br />-More realistic sideline personnel with ball-boys and extra camera crew as well as better camera angles<br /><br />Needs Improvement:<br />-Players on the sidelines without names on their jerseys?<br />-I make a field goal and no one in the crowd stands up to cheer – especially when I go up by 10 with under 2 minutes to go?<br />-Commentary, well, still is pretty boring.<br />-Occasional pixilation here and there – mostly on after play cut-scenes<br /><br />Overall:<br />Is it worth it for me? Yeah. It’s like the price of a nice meal out for 2 people… I’d prefer to have Madden 16 (over Madden 15) for a full year instead of a few drinks, wings, and an 8 oz sirloin steak at a restaurant for 1 night... But maybe that’s just me…",2015-08-29

I have to say this is my least favorite NFS game so far.<br />The game looks good on PS4, taking advantage of the new hardware and producing the best graphics in a NFS game yet. However, after just a few minutes of play I noticed glitches where textures wouldn't load in or my car would sink into the ground. That's disappointing considering this was developed by one of the richest most successful companies in the world. EA can and should do better.<br />The gameplay is fairly bland. You can play as a cop or a racer, and both offer three activities each. The lack of modes makes Rivals get stale quick.<br />As you play you earn Speed Points, which you then use to buy new cars, upgrades, weapons, etc. As a cop there's no risk of losing any points you earn, but as a racer you can and will lose all of your points often. In fact, as of this writing I have not once banked any points as a racer and thus have not been able to buy upgrades and progress in the game. The AI cops as well as the human player cops are super aggressive and without upgrades your car will be destroyed quickly. When this happens you are &#34;busted&#34; and lose your multiplier, all your Speed Points, and are booted to a long loading screen that takes you back to the garage. From there you go back to a long loading screen to return to the world and repeat. Whoever thought this was a good idea, it is not. It is the most frustrating, infuriating punishment I've had the misfortune of experiencing in a game. And I've been gaming for over 30 years.<br />If you like unfair, aggressive AI and losing over and over and having a game waste your time, buy this trash.",2015-08-29
US,2864234,R22IZ08VB2A605,B00I19TYW2,937933782,Alien: Isolation,Video Games,5,1,1,N,Y,Don't let mixed reviews scare you away.,"Admittedly I ordered a copy towards the end of July almost a year after the game was originally released when I should have just gotten it when it came out. This game is a must have for any fan of the alien movies and of survival horror.  The bad about this game is that their are a few glitches and character animation issues. Although the animation issues were mainly after the update to the game also some bad voice acting from minor characters. Amanda Ripley is a believe able character and a protagonist who I was rioting for the whole way. The alien is down right terrifying as it is a constant threat and its behavior is totally random, and the detail put into it is amazing. The world is visually identical to the first alien movie which is great and the graphics are awesome and space walks are pretty memorable. The weapons are awesome and the crafting can get you out of some tricky situations involving the Xeno, the creepy androids, and survivors on Sevastopol. Ammo is scarce as it should be so its best to conserve. Fire is your only true defense against the xenomorph and moltovs and the flamethrower is super effective but ammo goes super fast. You will also be tempted to let the Xeno kill you because the death animations are really cool. The androids are really creepy since they are cheap rubber skinned knock offs of Weyland Yutani's that spout safety protocol as they try to kill you. The bolt gun is the best way to kill them but once again ammo is scarce. The sound effects and score are also great and their are lots of hacking mini games and well done audio logs from the Sevastopol and even ones recorded by the original cast of Alien. Also trophy's/ achievements can all be earned offline and are fun to earn.

I started with games on the initial NES, continued playing with enjoying the pinnacle of the golden times of the N64. I owned a GameCube and enjoyed the little known gems of Eternal Darkness.  Owned a Wii enjoying the more casual new games of Wii Sports to the gems of Metroid Prime. This brings me to the Wii U. The high quality games aren't as abundant as have been in the past, but there are some gems, however the Wii U has some annoying problems.  First, I've always had problems getting Wifi to work. Second and more importantly, if your Gamepad that comes with the system breaks, you are close to SOL.  You can return it to Nintendo and be gouged for a repair at 2/3 cost of a new sytem, or you would think by a new gamepad, but no. Nintendo does not sell brand new gamepads. Long story short, if your gamepad breaks, which was surprisingly fragile, your systems become much more like a paper weight.

US,52542000,R8WD0136CETA7,B00W435BU0,487294121,Madden NFL 16,Video Games,2,99,119,N,N,Same Madden as last year with a couple of new gimmicks.,"The same thing plagues this version of Madden that has plagued it for years, and that is this: Pre-Determined Outcomes.<br /><br />This game decides what's going to happen, you don't.  Sure, it gives you the illusion that you have control by letting you press different buttons to throw to different receivers, etc. but the game still ultimately will decide who wins or loses even if they added some new gimmicky catch buttons for receivers.<br /><br />You can have Patrick Peterson and Richard Sherman as your cornerbacks and when the CPU decides it wants to pass the ball it will.  It doesn't matter how bad the opposing QB or WR's are either, they will juke your Hall of Fame CB's out of their shoes and you'll like it.  You can blitz, drop 9 into coverage, play man, play zone, it doesn't matter.  The CPU will win if it decides it wants to.<br /><br />And in the event that you somehow do manage to manually overcome the CPU's desires, the CPU will just pull it's little trump card, the penalty.  What's that?  You finally sacked the QB on 4th and 10?  Well, turns out you face masked him in the process.  Instant first down.  Sorry bout 'cha.<br /><br />This is the single most disappointing aspect of Madden football and it remains in the game year after year after year.  It RUINS the immersion.  It RUINS the feeling that you can actually defeat your opponent through your skill.  Instead of actually programming a solid and dynamic game, the developers rely on gimmicks like that in order to make the game appear to be challenging.  Well, I'm not fooled, I can spot lazy programming when I see it.  And if you think about it, the fact that the game even has varying difficulty levels proves it.  So on the rookie setting your bad left tackle will usually whip that Pro Bowl defensive end.  On All-Madden, your Pro Bowl left tackle will get dominated by a scrub.  What's the point of player attributes again?  Player attributes alone should determine the difficulty.  Build a crappy team, you're going to have a harder time.  Build a good team, and the game will be easier.  This isn't rocket science.<br /><br />I've known about pre-determined outcomes in Madden for a while and I still bought the game because I like to play franchise mode and pretend I'm a GM.  Having said that, there are a few changes to this year's franchise mode.<br /><br />You still spend scouting points on players, but instead of having the ability to unlock an actual attribute as a number, you instead are only allowed to see a letter grade for that player's 3 most important attributes.  At the scouting combine, you'll gain access to their measurables.  So you no longer need to spend scouting points to see what their speed is, if you saw that they ran a 4.28 forty then you know their speed is good.  If you saw that they did 45 reps on the bench press you know their strength is good, etc.<br /><br />So that part's a little different from years' past.  It adds a little more guesswork to your drafting than before since you can't unlock the numerical attribute, but for the most part you can spot a bust before you spend that draft pick on him.<br /><br />Trade logic appears to have improved some.  In years past CPU teams would trade good young players for 1st round picks which made no sense.  It seems teams value their good young players a little more now and won't so readily trade them only to try to draft another good young player to replace him.<br /><br />Other than that, it's the same old Madden.  Good graphics?  Sure.  Fancy presentation?  You bet.  An enjoyable and realistic simulation of NFL football?  Not a chance.  Madden hasn't really changed since 08 and it never will until they throw their entire code away and start from scratch.  And to do it right would take a few years.  Well EA's not going to go years without putting a yearly Madden on the shelves, there's too much money to be made.  Instead they'll update the rosters, tack on a few new gimmicks (this year's new gimmickis the different catch options for receivers) spend exorbitant amounts of money marketing it and laugh all the way to the bank.  EA still has exclusivity with the NFL, so until we as the consumers stop giving them our money (I was guilty this year but hadn't bought once since Madden 11) then nothing will ever change.is the different catch options for receivers) spend exorbitant amounts of money marketing it and laugh all the way to the bank.

I only have a few real complaints about the game. First, I can't stand Phil Simms as the announcer. I like the guy as a quarterback, but his voice and comments are just headache inducing. I never realized how much I liked John Madden until I've had several years of Phil Simms (no disrespect). Second, navigating menus and different game modes can be rather slow at times. I feel like literally everything has to load and the load times can be painfully annoying. It's nit picky, I know. Third, the new method of catching balls can be kinda comical and ridiculous. I've had instances were you throw a bullet across the middle and some random low ranked Linebacker makes a one handed interception! Or you throw a lob pass and your receiver makes some hug leaping one handed catch (like the one Odell Beckham Jr made). These catches are once in a life time, but now in Madden 16, they can be rather common. It's a video game, I get it. I'm nit picking. It's a fun and enjoyable game at the end of the day. Worth $40 for sure.",2015-08-29

US,554437,R1T6U2ZTAVYG9T,B00ZMBLKPG,966892383,Gears of War: Ultimate Edition - Xbox One,Video Games,1,6,44,N,N,A massive waste of time,"I remember buying an xbox 360 and gears of war almost a decade ago. I remember it being the reason sony lost the console war. Gears of war trashed resistance fall of man. Back then, the graphics, gameplay, physics, and even the AI, story, and characters, were all strikingly new and fresh. Of course, you can't praise gears' story and characters without getting mocked, but I remember being interested in the main character, imprisoned for desertion/treason by the coalition of organized governments, who is then freed out of desperation as humanity runs out of soldiers.<br /><br />The city you explore is one that fell during Marcus' incarceration.  The court that convicted him has been abandoned to the locust, and the people who convicted him are either dead or evacuated.  Awesome.<br /><br />What's special about it, is that he never turns his back on humanity. &#34;i'm not doing this for you&#34;.<br /><br />I still love hearing Marcus Fenix voice.  It's got that movie magic to it, and it's an strong now as it was then.  The haunting song &#34;14 years after E day&#34; still perfectly helps set the dark tone of the game.  The sound design is still king.<br /><br />Everything about it felt next gen, aside from the laggy, host advantage peer to peer online gameplay. One shotgun roller was in a class of his own, and you just had to hope it was you, or at least that he was on your team.<br /><br />Much of it has aged.  Most of it poorly.  You basically move from cover to cover, shooting enemies, for hours on end with very little else happening to break up the monotony.<br /><br />The time and effort they put into reskinning this game could have been invested in a brand new game entirely, a new story, new characters, Hell, maybe even a brand new franchise.<br /><br />It feels like the only reason this game exists is to make money. Fans of the franchise, like me, already played gears of war multiple times back when it was new.<br /><br />I just fail to grasp the concept here. What were they thinking?<br /><br />It's ironic because the problems with gears of war were obviously never it's graphics. So they tried to fix the graphics. wtf?<br /><br />Why remake a decade old game without changing anything but the graphics? Who was like 'gears of war will sell copies once we fix the graphics'  lol...  who greenlit this project?<br /><br />It's painful how repetitive the game feels today. The whole production feels small now. It lacks the spectacle and scope of gears 2, the jaw dropping set pieces... I remember how satisfied I was to roll, roadie run, slide into and mantle over cover, stop and pop, back when I'd never done it before. But now we've all been doing this for 4 games. 4 Gears of War games, and now they try to get people to pay 40$ to replay the original? How many cover shooters have we played since then? Over and over and over and over, and now go back to the very first that got it right. And they want 40 dollars to do that?  And Microsoft wonders why they're losing this generation.  The asking price is an insult to fans of the franchise.  Gears 3 cost less at launch.<br /><br />Videogames, and even the gears of war franchise, have come a long way in the last 10 years. This remake hasn't.<br /><br />Gears, Grand Theft Auto, and  Uncharted, three of the highest reviewed franchises in existence, have been cranking out cover shooters for 9 years, and things have changed.<br /><br />Is Microsoft even going to try to beat Sony?  This isn't the way.  I also fail to see how this fits into Microsoft's arsenal of exclusive games.  What PS4 owner is going to say to themselves &#34;Gears of War one for 40 bucks?  I'm buying and Xbox One!&#34;  Nobody is going to say that.  When you look back at the megahits that shaped the Xbox brand, they were halo, Halo 2, and Gears of War.  Where does Gears of War Ultimate at this price point fit into the picture.  No where.  It's a huge misstep that fans of the franchise are never going to forget, and PS4gamers aren't going to care about.  You're either being insulted, or you just don't care.<br /><br />What we should have gotten, was a compilation of gears 1, 2, and 3 in 1080p and 60fps for 10$ or so.<br /><br />Also, the reskin doesn't look that much different than the original. If your'e going to reskin an entire game, shouldn't you be aiming for a completely different look? I mean, if you're trying to maintain the look, feel, and tone of the original, why the hell reskin it? Gears Ultimate wouldn't even look like the original if I had my way. You wouldn't even be able to recognize it. But not so, you always know exactly where you are, because you can always recognize the geometry and the colors and textures that look very similar. I never ever felt lost in a new game world. It's a testament to how iconic the original is/was, and yet another reason this game should never have been made.<br /><br />I'm not even sure if the remaster looks better than the original.  I know it doesn't look as good as Gears 4.<br /><br />Everytime I play Gears Ultimate, I wish I was playing Gears 4 instead.<br /><br />I should be able to easily see the graphical improvements given it's on a next gen console, but the only thing I'm sure of is that it's running at a higher resolution.  Big deal.  Higher res graphics do not always translate into better graphics.<br /><br />Gears of War's graphics were a masterpiece then, and in my eyes they still are.  It's a classic.  No need for a reskin.  It's the rest of the game that's the problem.<br /><br />Ultimate's graphics style is like  &#34;imagine if we made gears of war look more like every other game on the market&#34;.  It just feels bland and uninspired, like no one had a clear vision of what the game should be, and that's something gears of war never lacked, vision.  I think that's why this remake is such a failure.  It lacks the vision and sense of purpose of the original.<br /><br />I do not personally feel that the new textures look better all the time.  They usually have higher resolution, yes, but there are many times when I wonder if the original's graphics are superior.<br /><br />It does not look worse than the original, but I feel that most times it just looks a little different.  The plastic sheen on characters faces is lessened, and I agree that this might be somewhat of an improvement. I honestly feel like there should be no contest between this next gen remake and the original.  Gears Ultimate should be flat out wasting Gears one, and it doesn't.  It should be blatantly obvious which game looks better.  I don't really blame the artists for this.  There wasn't much room for improvement to begin with.<br /><br />Another irony. Microsoft needed gears of war last generation, needed a way to beat Sony. Yet again, Microsoft needs another gears of war, another way to beat sony. And here it is. haha. It's just like microsoft to crank out a game like this, especially for this price.<br /><br />They've finally stopped reselling us windows over and over, and started reselling us gears.<br /><br />What if instead of making this, they had made a prequel to Gears of War, where you start as Fenix fighting in the pendulum wars, then Emergence Day happens, and you attempt to repel the locust invasion.  Fight at asypho fields and see what happened there.  That would have been awesome.<br /><br />Or what if they retold Gears of War one in an alternate reality?  What if they decided to break Fenix out of prison against the cog's wishes?  What if you fought through the city as it was falling, rather than after it had fallen?<br /><br />Or what if everything had been redesigned, so it's the same exact story, but the shape and look of everything is different.  The prison and everthing else is designed differently, and all the boss fights redone with a different strategy to beat each?  So the plot is exactly the same but everything else is new?<br /><br />So many possibilities.  So many wasted opportunities.<br /><br />Gears of War 1 is simply a poor candidate for this kind of remaster. It was more about doing things 'new' than doing things well. More about revolution than evolution. It's a game that demanded sequels, demanded a franchise, demanded the creation of a new genre, and that genre has been in constant flux, constant evolution since then. Virtually almost everything about the original no longer holds up,  and now visually, it looks more like every other videogame than gears of war.  I shake my head at all this. Have the games graphics aged? Yes, a bit, and it's noticeable, but as I said before, so has everything else in the game, and they didn't see the need to fix any of that.<br /><br />Gears of war wasn't just a next gen game. it was a next gen franchise. An IP born at the start of the next generation. It took advantage of all the capabilities of the xbox 360. The entire game streamed right off the disc. There were no loading times unless you died. Each soldier in your squad had their own uniquely designed and textured in high definition armor. Weapons like the sub machine gun assault rifle chainsaw combo lancer, the hammer of dawn firing burning lasers from the sky, all the different locust enemies you'd never seen before, the 'destroyed beauty' art style. Getting downed from taking damage and hoping a teamate would revive you before you got curb stomped. It was a rush of new, burning passion. And that deserves another new game, with the same drive to take us new places and show us new things. Not a reskin.<br /><br />I am glad that they have finally fixed the multiplayer with dedicated servers, but its 10 years too late.  I remember how disappointed I was trying to play the original online.  Emptying entire clips into enemies and not killing them, instantly dying from a shotgun running host.  It was miserable.  The online was really the only thing about the game that didn't work.  I remember how stoked I was to get into multplayer, and damn, was it a massive let down.  Gear one was basically unplayable.<br /><br />You know, thinking back to Gears one reminds me of the achievement &#34;always remember your first&#34; that you earn after your first chainsaw kill. &#34;always remember your first&#34;.... can any gamer forget the first time they played gears of war? What a rush. What I want, is the next gears of war. The next shocking new experience that I'll never forget.<br /><br />*update -  I've now completely finished the campaign, and I have very little to add except that I was exhausted and grateful when the train ride was over.  Memorable moments like blowing up chaps gas station are ruined by some of the fakest looking explosions I have ever seen.  I also noticed that many character models look worse than they did in the original.  I played most of the game coop as the host, and it was, at least on my end, a lag free experience.  AI Dom kept getting cornered and killed by the bezerker over and over again.<br /><br />I still feel that the game makes a mistake by not letting you rescue civilians.  there's a sense that there's nothing left to fight for or protect because the game is lacking in interesting and likeable characters aside from dom and the main protagonist, but it's realistic that there's nobody left to defend in a city that fell to the locust long ago.<br /><br />The added brumak fight is anticlimactic and boring, just like I remember it from the pc version.  The brumak is supposed to be scary, but the dialogue and actions of your squad diminish that fear completely.<br /><br />On the multiplayer side of things, the lack of lag online has made super weapons incredibly dangerous, and all of them are easy to use.  I don't like weilding them.  It feels like cheating.  Epic should have rebalanced these weapons but they didn't.  I do not like exploiting the flaws in the system, it feels like i'm taking advantage of other people.  But you can't just let the enemy capture them, or else you're sure to loseevery match.  Simply put, the grenade, boomshot and torque bow are game breaking flaws, and to a lesser extent, so is the longshot.<br /><br />Of course, you have the option of 2v2 gnasher shotgun matches, but I don't want to play 4 player games.  I have no idea why there isn't a 4v4 gnasher mode.  perplexing and irritating.<br /><br />Grenades make a small explosion compared to their max effective range.  Most of the time I never even see the blast, my body just disappears into a few chunks of meat for no reason.  Grenade area of effect is absolutely insane and needs to be reduced immediately.<br /><br />The biggest problem with multiplayer is that you can't see the crosshairs of your shotgun without aiming down your sites.  It's a problem, because identifying exactly where the center of the screen is at while moving, watching your teamates moving, and watching your enemies moving all at the same time, is very difficult.<br /><br />This is a problem that existed 10 years ago, and it still exists today.  Players are forced to tape crosshairs onto their televisions so they can blind fire the shotgun and hit their targets.  It's the only way to compete, but I refuse to do it because I know that there are other players like me who are against cheating.<br /><br />The result is a game that is unplayable.<br /><br />You can't aim with your shotgun without slowing down, which makes you an easy target.  You also can't instantly aim and have crosshairs appear, it takes precious milliseconds.  The best way to die against a player who has taped crosshairs onto their screen is to attempt to aim at them.  You become a large, motionless target.<br /><br />Of course, epic could easily patch the problem and give everyone with the shotgun blind fire crosshairs, but out of what I imagine to be sheer laziness, they haven't.<br /><br />Epic :  I am not going to tape crosshairs to my TV.

The best way to die against a player who has taped crosshairs onto their screen is to attempt to aim at them.  You become a large, motionless target.  Of course, epic could easily patch the problem and give everyone with the shotgun blind fire crosshairs, but out of what I imagine to be sheer laziness, they haven't.  Epic :  I am not going to tape crosshairs to my TV.  Fix your game.",2015-08-29
US,40001616,RHQ5GV249SVU,B00MV7KVP4,92208606,Until Dawn  - PlayStation 4 [Digital Code],Video Games,5,4,5,N,N,Absolutely amazing.,Just finished one full night of this game. Missed a ton of stuff (apparently) and got a couple people killed due to a toy from my son hitting the couch when I was to remain completely still and any SLIGHT movement meant death. This game is freaking amazingly done and completely nailbiting. I highly recommend this game as it is an edge of your seat thriller that has an amazing story line and even better plot development (that is solely based on how you handle different scenarios). Every action you take or words you decide to say have an everlasting effect on the remainder of the story. Lots of recognizable actors and it made me jump more than any movie I have ever watched.<br /><br />Watching the behind the scenes and R and D they put into this game made it even more enjoyable to play.,2015-08-29

Upon getting it, saw that it has firmware 3.10 on it and it said that a firmware update was needed. Proceeded with the firmare update and selected that English to be displayed on the main menu. Checking out the Japanese PSN store, there are numerous Japanese region Vita, PS1 game titles and PSP titles that are downloadable but the movies and anime DL selection are a bit sorely lacking (there is a more robust selection of movies to d/l on the USA region PSN site indeed). Does have an internal 1GB of memory for Vita games, Vita game demos, Vita game updates & FMV clips d/l'ed off the JPN region PSN site (but that isn't user accessible once you insert a Vita memory card). The use of an optional 64GB sized Vita memory card works like a charm on the Vita TV micro-console (it'll say that 60GB are available for use once properly formatted upon inserting it for the first time). However, if you insert a Vita memory card associated with a USA region PS Vita user account, it'll say that the content isn't compatible for use with the Vita TV console and if you wish to use it, delete the content so that it may be reformatted to be used properly.<br /><br />What's cool is that if you have a Japanese PS3 user account set up on your PS3 gaming console, any of the Vita game demos, Vita game FMV clips & Japanese region PSP game demos that you've previously downloaded off of the Japanese PSN site and saved to the PS3's HDD, they can be transferred to the Vita TV micro-console's internal 1GB memory or saved to an inserted Vita memory card via USB 2.0 link cable setup -- how cool is that?<br /><br />Of course, considering that this particular Vita TV micro-console is just the system itself, a supplied AC adapter, and included HDMI cable -- noDual Shock 3 controller is supplied whatsoever and one will have to sourced to be utilized when powered on.<br /><br />Makes an ideal companion piece to your existing Japanese region Vita gaming handheld.",2015-08-29

It’s actually is enjoyable to play. I prefer using wiimote controls to play this game.<br /><br />Transform into a squid when needed. Blast others with ink. Neat idea! Only thing I wish it had more options for single player. I like the notion of identifying with animals in a game which is pretty neat. Nintendo tends to do that with many of it’s games (Zelda, Marios, Donkey Kong, Deep Ocean to name a few). I can play Splatoon with others than me without having to worry about an over saturated amount of violence. I also now have a better appreciation for squids. Feel like painting some wall somewhere with bright colors after playing Splatoon.<br /><br />Try this out:<br />Play Splatoon in your backyard in 480p (some resolutions are still better for certain things) with color saturation settings set to max next to a waterslide when it’s hot out.

We purchased this solely for our younger daughters to use with their Just Dance games.  Camera picks their movements up just fine.  Is it exact...no, but being that they no longer have to hold a controller when dancing, makes this not such a big deal.  Our major complaint with this camera in general, is the cord that you have to connect into the Playstation  is super short.  When my husband went to Best Buy to purchase another identical one to make it longer, they told him only the manufacturer makes it and it would need to be ordered through them, online.  When we received the additional cord, it didn't fit into the original cord to extend it.  Come to find out, others have had the same issue and have posted on forums online that there is no way to extend the length of the cord at this time.  Major bummer if you're Playstation is hooked up on the other side of the room, such as if you have a media room for this kind of hobby.  We ended up having to move the entire Playstation closer to our screen, which then meant we needed to make other cords not related to this camera, longer.  More extensions needed.

As a casual gamer, this game system is satisfactory, such that it's 500 GB hard drive is more than enough to store my game data, videos, and music. It's super slim design makes for easy placement anywhere in my home where there's a TV. Plus, it is said to use less energy than it's preceding version, the PS3 slim version usually holding an average 250 GB. It shows, as older models tend to fire off like a heating system or an air conditioner after moderate to heavy use. There are no signs of the console burning out, even after several hours of gameplay. (Note: extend the longevity of your game system by not using it so often, you all know the drill.) I keep some space open around my console so it doesn't overheat. The price of the console when I bought it reflected well for my budget too, as I saw it as less than a dollar for every gigabyte storage in the console's hard drive. All in all, if you want the ultimate gaming experience without paying an arm and a leg for the newer PS4, buy this PS3. Even with changes in its design -- there is a hatch covering any inserted game disc that can be opened by pressing the eject button adjacent to the power button on the front -- the console functions in the same capacity as its older models. Some may see this as a downgrade from what is featured with the older models, but it's really of no consequence to me. It enhances that DVD/Blu-Ray kind of feel for me when inserting discs into the the console. Good price for a good device, and well worth the investment… if it doesn't burn out and experience that yellow light of death often seen with the &#34;fat&#34; models.",2015-08-29

First off, I rented this from Redbox. It took me roughly 7 and a half hours on my first run, mainly because I was looking for every clue and totem in the game. Since the game is essentially like a playable movie, I would say even if you &#34;speed ran&#34; the game it would still take you 4-5 hours because you cannot skip scenes. This game is awesome! If you are a fan of horror movies, this is definitely a homage to them. The overall graphics, score and atmosphere is excellent. The characters are great cliche's of their horror movie counterparts and at first I was wanting pretty much all of them to die, but as the game developed I began routing for most of them.The plot is broken into a prologue, 10 story chapters and an epilogue. The plot itself is fairly predictable, but does have a few effective twists in the last quarter of the game.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Horror/Slasher genre is on point!<br />-Visually this game is stunning, especially the lighting effects.<br />-Hayden Panettiere, Peter Stomare, Rami Malek and Brett Dalton are superb. The rest of the cast is great, but not standouts.<br />-The story was very unique (surprisingly) and had unforeseen twists.<br />-A LOT to discover everywhere you go<br />-Characters (other than Emily, Matt & Jessica) have growth over the entire story arc<br />-The game truly has multiple endings<br />-You can determine who from the group lives and dies by your actions<br />-Controls are simplistic and work well with the game-type<br />-Cinematography is eerily effective<br />-Ability to revisit chapters to complete collection of clues & totems<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Cannot skip cut scenes (mainly for re-playing chapters for trophy hunting)<br />-Takes a few hours for the story to &#34;take off.&#34;",2015-08-29

Better once he's upgraded of course.  I prefer rocket path over bomb buddies.  The big bonus of getting kick-off countdown over reg. Countdown is he is a special version  (generally a stat boost for special skylanders).. but the big bonus of special swap force skylanders such as kick off countdown,  Easter version of trigger happy & Jolly bumble blast is that their stat boosts come in the form of a hat u can use on any skylander. That's a huge improvement from previous game offerings. These guys r worth it for their fabulous hats & good news is, they're generally very inexpensive, as opposed to some other special versions like nitro or legendary which do not give u special hats. I got kick off countdown new for $1.99. Jolly Bumble blast pre owned for a few bucks & same w/ Easter version of trigger happy.  So that adds to the beauty of these 3 special guys. I use kick off hat & jolly hat the most. Great stats. Triple boost from all 3 hats. I know soccer hat is speed, critical hit & health & jolly hat is speed, armor & health.  Good #'s too. Can't remember spring time hat boosts but nice #'s on that too.<br /><br />  For ppl mentioning open pkg's.. while some may b from jerks who opened, be aware that skylander pkgs r not all that sturdy & often fall apart in stores.. I have purchased some as gifts & cover fell off b4 I could give gift. It's actually pretty common. If they don't work, u should absolutely exchange them tho. No reason u should b stuck w/ a non working item. Amazon will exchange, if seller gives u hard time, contact<br />Amazon directly. Gamestop, walmart, best buy all exchange if purchased there too. If u run into trouble contact Activision for replacement but it's obviously much easier thru store or Amazon if possible.  Hope this helps.",2015-08-29

US,20183338,REUIPU1IQYA09,B00004W4R0,999657958,WCW Backstage Assault,Video Games,3,1,1,N,N,Decent End To WCW's Video Game History,"WCW Backstage Assault is a mixed bag as many people since its November 2000 release have given mixed (mainly bad) reviews on the game that is Backstage Assault. I recently bought this game for a relatively cheap price to see how the game was for myself so here it is. For starters I want to say that when you play this for the first time, it's ridiculously difficult to even try and set up a match. Finally once you've managed to get past the annoying superstar selection screen, you get to choose from 7 different areas to fight your opponent in that include a truck arena, the locker rooms, the loading bay, bathrooms, the block, the parking garage, and the media center. The only available area upon first playing the game is the truck arena. All other areas must be unlocked, but I'll get to that in a moment.  Backstage Assault has a fairly large roster containing most--if not all of the WCW superstars that were on TV in 1999 and 2000. It was also the first game to feature WCW women as default characters on the roster, making it one of the largest rosters in WCW's gaming history. Among the stars and women in this game include Goldberg, Sting, Hulk Hogan, Jeff Jarrett, Major Gunns, Sid Vicious, Mona, Booker T, DDP, Kimberly, Rey Mysterio, Torrie Wilson, Scott Steiner, Miss Hancock, Vince Russo, Bret Hart, and many more. Of course with men and women on the roster, that also meant you could do several intergender matches. Want Goldberg to lay a beatdown on Major Gunns? You can make it happen. Want Torrie Wilson to beat Scott Steiner into submission? Go for it!  There are only 3 different matches to play. You can choose between regular, First Blood, or Human Torch. Regular and First Blood are pretty self-explanatory, while the Torch Match involves you having to set your opponent on fire to win the match.  There are 2 different features to play in this game that include Hardcore Challenge Mode and Hardcore Gauntlet. Hardcore Challenge Mode was pretty much similar to Mayhem's Quest For The Best Mode, only you were fighting backstage. The premise of Hardcore Challenge Mode involves you choosing a WCW superstar and playing as them through a series of backstage matches as you vie for the Hardcore, US, and World Titles. Along the way, with each match you win, you'll unlock new fighting areas, new weapons, and new women and superstars to play as.  Hardcore Gauntlet sees your superstar fight 7 other opponents in back to back matches with no time to rest or recover. If you lose a match, you can't replay it and will have to start all over again. And when the smoke clears, if you've managed to overcome and prevail in both the Hardcore Gauntlet and Hardcore Challenge Mode, then you just may find yourself among the top 10 in the Hall of Champions.  Now for the final part; gameplay. Gameplay pace moves at a similar, decent pace as it did in Mayhem. The only problem with the game is how unbelievably difficult it becomes to keep your opponent down for a 3 count. Seriously, I played a match with Goldberg against Jeff Jarrett and after nearly 5 minutes of constantly driving Jarrett into the concrete and beating him senseless with nearly every weapon in sight, he still continued to kick out every time I pinned him, time and time again. Now I'm all for a challenge, but having your opponent no-sell your attacks isn't a challenge, it's just annoying. The thing that really turns me away from the gameplay is the cheesy effects added to it. If you ever low blown an opponent, you'll be met with a cheesy boink sound effect or whistle sound effect. Like why? Just why? And of course, to call the action for WCW's last video game is Tony Schiavone and Bobby Heenan.   Overall: For WCW's final video game, this wasn't all it could've been. Somewhere, some genius back in 2000 thought it'd be a great idea to completely toss out the wrestling ring and have nothing but backstage fighting. While on paper it may have sounded like a good idea, actually going through with it wasa mistake as fighting backstage in every match gets old really quick. Kind of like most things on WCW television during the time this game came out, Backstage Assault took something cool and ran it into the ground until the point it was no longer something interesting or fun. Had they kept the in-ring aspect in this game and worked on adding other features, then this could've been a really great game. Something not many know is that a follow up to Backstage Assault was being planned but it would be called Mayhem 2. So it was ultimately a sequel to Mayhem but had the same concept as Backstage Assault. Set for a Playstation 2 release in October 2001, it looked to be the greatest WCW game never made. Mayhem 2 would still take place backstage, but with a Def Jam like theme with bigger and larger areas to fight in and even a story mode with branching stories. Unfortunately because WCW went out of business in March 2001, the game never made it past its early developing stage. Instead, we're left with this average, somewhat forgettable game that is Backstage Assault to put the exclamation point on WCW's video games. Overall, Backstage Assault is a decent game. It's fun to finally get to play as the women of WCW as well as play as a lot of the popular stars that were in WCW during that time, but after 7 or 8 matches, the game loses its flavor and becomes bland and lackadaisical. If you're a big fan of WCW and/or its video games, then give this a try; otherwise, just settle for Smackdown 2 Know Your Role--which outshone this game when it came out just weeks after Backstage Assault",2015-08-29

I just don't like the way they did it.<br />The running game is an impossibility with the exception of a few plays that actually work because within the new animations, the offense moves at an almost snails pace in play action which allows the defense to pounce before the quarterback can hand the ball off. In addition, the defense on running plays lives in the backfield because the block is very stagnant and doesn't resemble they way the pros run block from an offensive line point of view.  With regards to passing, it's actually fun, however, if the receiver doesn't catch the ball after you have gone for the aggressive catch, there will be most like an interception. If you somehow overthrow a wide open target, there will be most likely an interception. When I play games against the computer as I have been lately using the Seahawks against the Chargers on All Madden Level I have been getting beat almost everytime because the offensive line blocking doesn't hold up. My QB has gotten sacked consecutively so fast  at the snap of the ball  that it happens within the blink of an eye and leaves me asking what just happened! Rarely does this happen in professional football in this manner!<br />One other thing that I wish EA would change. Football is a natural game played in natural way. This game is not fully natural the way shooting games are. I don't like the fact that the QB is sacked when a defender is with 5-7 yards. The QB, it seems cannot complete the natural throwing motion which you and I would be able to do in similar situations! The QB has to have a throwing radius of 180 degrees. EA falls short in this aspect because it allows the position of the defenders to dictate the accuracy of the throw!<br /><br />Lastly, there are three things to look forward to in this addition of Madden;<br /><br />1.Exhilarating long distance catches...the QB can actually throw the ball above defenders...(hope they never stop this feature)<br />2. More interceptions because of the new wr/db interactions<br />3. More sacks because the O-line blocking should have been better!<br /><br />Finally!, there is still room for improvement and it looks like EA is on the right track with this addition of Madden.<br />The question is, how long will it be before we get a simulated football game that can do everything?",2015-08-29

So not only do we have a Rock Band game on the PSP and a conversion of Lego Rock Band for the DS, but we also get a version of the numbered sequel on the go! While certain home-to-small-screen transitions of video games have been handled as half-hearted cash grabs, others give the handhelds a complementary experience, and that's exactly what Rock Band 3 provides.<br /><br />If you've played the other portable Rock Bands before, you'll know what to expect from this one. If not, don't worry; I got ya covered. Unlike the Guitar Hero games on DS, you don't need a peripheral to play this game, so not only is it less expensive to boot, but it can even be played on a Nintendo DSi or 3DS. Instead, you play using the DS's own buttons. The A, B, Y, and X buttons are all for hitting the notes (they are assigned to the specific colors of course). The unique difference (between consoles and DS anyway) is that you gain control of all four instruments, each with their own layouts of notes, and you must hop around to use them via the L and R buttons. To do well at earning stars on your performance, you must react quickly when one instrument's note layouts ends and another starts up next to you and keep hitting the notes without missing one for note streaks. And of course, the mic can be used to double your scores temporarily (a la Guitar Hero's Star Power)<br /><br />All things considered, the resulting rhythm gameplay is neat and addicting. Playing songs, especially on difficulties like Hard mode, make the game fast-paced and the combo-triggering can make for a good motivation to try and keep at it. The music selection amounts to a healthy 25 songs, and most of them are goodies I'd be happy to jam to. I actually like this game more than I do Lego Rock Band, because not only are the graphics much more interesting to look at, but what I wasn't so fond of in Lego was that you were able to stick with one instrument during gameplay, and if you do that, you'd just experience repetitive rows of notes throughout the song. Here, Rock Band 3 requires that you keep going and help the entire band stay on their feet, especially considering not taking part in the other note tracks would mean the other instruments may end up in desperate need to survive with the whole band. It keeps gameplay NOT repetitive by making use of all four note tracks instead of making that an option. And as far as I can tell, the campaign isn't rehashing songs as much as Lego Rock Band's.<br /><br />It's Rock Band on the DS made more fun than before, and for that I wholeheartedly recommend this game to rhythm game fans, and for those interested in playing a Rock Band game, but don't feel like going through the tedium and spending of buying each peripheral. It's inexpensive, portable, and a great play. Now if only there was a 3DS version of Rock Band 4.wasn't so fond of in Lego was that you were able to stick with one instrument during gameplay, and if you do that, you'd just experience repetitive rows of notes throughout the song.

US,3407357,RKUYUXCUW6U,B0132BDUAU,361457716,TNTi&trade; T-1200 Controller Core - Xbox One Rechargeable Battery with Play and Charge Power Cable,Video Games,5,5,6,N,N,Charge Up Quick,So most of you who have some game console know that you always need a extra battery pack of some sort to keep you able to play your games for all day. I'm sure many of you use lots of batteries if you have kids who play the game all day. But now you might have a solution to this issue of yours and you won't have any MISSING batteries.<br /><br />When I tried this charger out the remote control was completely dead. I placed the battery into the controller and let me tell that it has a lot of power because it has been two days and the controller is still rolling.  I usually go through packs of batteries in a week which costed me money I don't have to be wasting. We go through so many batteries because we play like almost day since it's summer and there's not much to do. The kids also cause me a high light bill too. I like that when the battery dies you could use the USB wire cable as a a wired controller too. Since the wire reaches 9 feet  long this is awesome too because you sit from the tv and still play. You can also use the charger while it's charging but I don't do that because I don't want to mess up the charger. When I went to charge it the charging only took a little over 2 hours to fully charge. I would definitely recommend this charger because it works great with the Xbox one control and it's worth the price.<br /><br />*I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.

Tech: I played SWTOR for about a month then the game wouldn’t load anymore. There were smaller problems before that, connection loss etc. I don’t know if my internet provider throttled the game to death (as it does every website and video) or it was a SWTOR thing but I was already kind of bored with the game.  Game: The combat is ok. You and your companions share up to 3 abilities. Beyond that you can’t really customize your character's abilities except by buying stuff with credits. The graphics are fine (the ships are particularly impressive). The game just isn't that engaging and it’s too focused on credits.  A short list of what you have to pay to do in SWTOR: Increase the size of your inventory. Go to another planet. Get to a new location on the planet.  Upgrade your gear. Upgrade your companion’s skill to maximum. Use Legacy “rewards.” To access each part of a new stronghold. You even pay to sell things to other players on the Galaxy Trade Network.  Multiplayer: Flashpoints allow you to join a group of players to go kill a bunch of people. Sometimes players fall out but group combat was fairly smooth. Its run, fight, thanks for the fight and everybody goes their separate ways. I understand. They’re busy. Credits don’t make themselves.  I was on a PVE story-server, as opposed to an RP-PVP server. Mass PVP didn’t appeal to me. In between typical social media “discussions,” players occasionally yell about their guilds. I accepted a personal invite. No one in the guild ever chatted. I assume we were all invited at random and were focused on our own goals. An MMO might be good if you already know people you are going to play with. Otherwise you use (and are used by) strangers like companions in a video game anyway.  It was never not-interesting being in the Star Wars universe but the wonder wore off surprisingly quickly. You are surrounded by the environment but not immersed in it. Kind of like a theme park. There was an Old Republic video game that’s supposed to be good. I'll probably try that. Maybe it will run.  *The cartel is a catalog you access when you are logged in but it is not part of the game.",2015-08-29

I decided to try the PS4 version and while I found it enjoyable, it's not among my favorite open world games.  I found the learning curve in the beginning to be a little steep.  I never could quite get down the mechanics of fighting.  Sometimes Wei would just stand there as I was hitting the buttons to get him to move.  I'm not sure if it was because I was mashing the buttons too hard or if it was a glitch.  Luckily, you can buy upgraded outfits that come with weapons.  The game became much easier once I had a sword and a gun.  Still, there were little bugs where my gun would randomly disappear or Wei wouldn't pick up a knife that was dropped by another enemy.<br /><br />I was able to overlook the glitches because this game is fun overall.  I loved driving around the open world of Hong Kong.  It was fun to play a game that wasn't set in the U.S.  The game features lots of side missions that I enjoyed playing.  My favorite side mission was the drug bust one where you have to hack a camera and then catch a criminal remotely.  The characters in this game slowly grew on me.  At first, I found them all rather irritating, but Wei and his best friend grew on me to the point where I cared what happened to them.<br /><br />Overall, this game is worth playing if you're a fan of open world games.  It's a great value and it comes with all of the DLC.  I enjoyed playing it while waiting for the blockbuster games to come out this year.",2015-08-29

Straight to the point:<br />Not everyone is going to like this game.<br />I however, have put 1250 hours into this game, it is so addicting. The reward system is set up to give you completely random rewards and for most content you aren't guaranteed anything. If you get this you will be hunting down a particular weapon for hundreds of hours. If you don't like the sound of that, it's not for you.<br />As of right now the story is completely absent from destiny. This may change with the new expansion: The Taken King. It looks promising and if you're just getting destiny it is a great deal. The original game plus 2 dlc's ($20 a piece) plus the Taken King expansion for $60.<br />Despite its current lack of story, the competitive multiplayer is amazing. In no other first person shooter do you get the visual feedback on your screen like in destiny. It shows how much health an opponent has left and is all around great fun. Weapon balancing is an issue right now for the competitive multiplayer, as only a few top tier &#34;exotic&#34; weapons rule this game mode. However they are releasing a patch soon to rebalance the weapons (something they do every few months) and I hope it'll bring other weapons up to par.<br />All in all, I have loved every second of this game. I don't know how long I will play it, but I'm not stopping anytime soon.<br /><br />Onto The Taken King, guardians",2015-08-29

If you're looking for a deep story, good mechanics and a well-crafted game world, you need to move along to another game.<br /><br />I could never get into the Atelier series.  They seemed custom crafted to appeal to gamers who love chirpy, super cute graphics.  Atelier Shallie promised to be the best of the series so I checked it out and was very disappointed.<br /><br />Graphics:<br />The graphics are pretty good.  The environments can be a little sparse but the character design is bright and colorful with quite a lot of details.  You can tell that Gust was working on attracting the neckbearded anime nerds and female Goth/Loli lovers with the designs.  The menus are bright and the color palette seems to strike the right blend of gloom (the world maps) and cute (the menu screens).<br /><br />Sound:<br />The music is bland and entirely forgettable.  The character voices are stereotypically Japanese (if you play with Japanese dialogue turned on).  Girls' voices are at the upper end of dog hearing and the guys are about 1 notch below.  Enemies don't make much noise, at all.<br /><br />Gameplay:<br />The main thrust of the game is doing missions and synthesizing items with alchemy.  This is about 80% of the game and if you are into this kind of thing then you will love this game.  The areas (just one or two screens each) can be selected and you can run through them and battle enemies and harvest items.  The items and monsters respawn each time you go through.  The big problem is that battles are either really easy or impossible.  You'll blow through normal enemies and then you'll meet a HUGE monster that you cannot even dent.  Death means nothing and you just go back to the World Map.  The battle mechanics are OK and you can keep a reserve member to help defend or attack.  The problem is that the battle animations are rough: enemies fade away, attack animations are choppy and the battles seem like just a waste of time.  You get seemingly arbitrary amounts of experience points and there's no real way to judge if a battle will be easy other than to just try and see if you can win.<br /><br />Plot:<br />Milquetoast Shallie or Incompetent Shallie has to do a bunch of quests because blahblahblahblah.  The plot is almost nonexistent and creates no urgency or wonder or anything but &#34;now do this quest and then after that do this one.&#34;  It's like running down a checklist. None of the characters have anything but basic, stereotypical personalities.<br /><br />This game has potential but falls short on an enjoyable experience.  It's almost as if a design team said &#34;what if we stopped taking time to write a plot and just made the sidequests into the main quests?&#34;",2015-08-29

Another game to enjoy that does not glorify murder and mayhem which has become so common in video games today. One of the reasons I like Nintendo games like Deep Ocean.

The thumbstick, buttons, and C-stick were working perfectly, but I quickly discovered something alarming. The D-pad seems to be extremely sensitive to ALL of my GameCube games. When I press up, down, left, or right, it thinks I'm pressing a diagonal input. I play half my GameCube games with the D-pad and I find it frustrating that the controls aren't functioning properly.

US,24910296,R20AY7SZQNHQO,B00EFRN2IQ,793022980,Sims 4,Video Games,4,0,1,N,N,tl;dr - Solid game but wait for a sale because $60 is a lot for a base game,"I waited to get the Sims 4 until about a week ago, as I wait for every Sims upgrade, and really any game upgrade the I know will come with expansions, etc. Why? Because when you buy a new version of a game that you have every expansion and mod known to man for and then have to revert back to playing just a base game without even bug fixes, it's always going to suck. Always. So, I've waited til there was a sale (because no Sims base game is worth $60) and picked up the basic version. Since I waited, many of the issues (no pools, no dishwashers, etc) were fixed with game patches. This is the case with pretty much every game anymore, so be aware that many &#34;huge&#34; or &#34;unfixable&#34; issues people were freaking out about have already been fixed.<br /><br />First, yes, it definitely is different than the Sims 3. In a lot of ways, this is great. I don't mind a 5 second load screen between locations when it means I don't have a 5 minute load time initially. The Sims 3 took forever to get up and running, and that always annoyed me. Also, the world is what I'd call &#34;semi-open&#34;. There are little neighborhoods that the Sims seem to be able to pop around in without a load screen, and when your Sim is out of their home lot, you still have partial control over the sim at home (you can make them &#34;take care of self&#34; &#34;build skill...&#34; and other general activities). Relationships also take A LOT longer. My first household was two Sims living together, and they aren't in love after like a day. It does seem a big more organic and not like it takes TOO long based on the Sim's lifespan. However, if you want to have a Don Juan/Juanita type Sim, it'll definitely be harder.<br /><br />One of the things I do miss, kind of, from the Sims 3 is Create-a-Style. I thought I'd miss it way more than I do, though. For sure, I miss being able to make custom hair colors and modify make up colors. Even with mods, not all the mods have the exact same color of hair and soyou kind of end up stuck using one creator's hair styles. Generally, it's not a problem if you want to use someone like Skysims or Nightcrawler because they already have lots of styles out, but if it's a newer mod creator it can be annoying since they don't have like 100 hairstyles I can choose from. I also miss being able to change the bed linen colors, and the walls. However, there are a lot of built in options so generally, I was able to find something I liked fine in the base game as far as furnishings. Of course, we'll get more and better furnishings each time we pony up for an expansion pack, or if you go and look at thesimsresource.com or modthesims.com. MOST experienced Sim players already mod their games to hell and back, so I think losing Create-a-Style hasn't been as bad as it could be, but I do wish it was available for the less tech savvy among us who can only download and install custom content, as opposed to creating it (If you aren't downloading custom content from the above sites, I encourage you to start. They have content for ALL Sims games and instructions on how to add it to your game. It's very easy and really fun!).<br /><br />A handful of items are &#34;unlockable&#34; by achieving certain things (like reaching the top of a career or something). Since I mod my games into oblivion, the idea of unlocking an item is kind of a fun side-quest type thing, as opposed to super annoying given the small amount of items overall.<br /><br />Build mode is different, but I think it's MUCH better. First, there are premade rooms, which is a nice shortcut when building. Second, roofs are far more complex now. There's no auto-roof, but it's not as difficult to make cool looking roofs anymore, either. It's hard to explain how build mode is different, exactly, but it seemed easier to use. Buy mode has to be accessed through build mode, and has the same options of searching by room or by item type. Buy mode confused me for a second but I don't mind it now.<br /><br />You also only get three traits per sim! That part is kind of dumb. Maybe an university pack will allow a fourth, or something, but it still seemed kind of light on the personality and I wish I could have added two more traits. :( Additionally, I think some of the skills are less intuitive. For example, you have to find an actual fishing spot to fish, as opposed to just clicking on the water or looking for a school of fish. I had to ask Google for help on that one. lol But there are more skills, so there's that.<br /><br />As far as similarities, in the base game, you control your Sim at work the same way, with a handful of options. You can text<br /><br />One of the new additions I didn't think I'd care about but kind of like now is the emotions. It's more complex than &#34;Sim has to pee&#34; &#34;Sim is hungry&#34; or what have you. The emotions stack, and modify each other, and while they sometimes relate to the needs (such as being uncomfortable or bored), other times they're outside the needs or sparked from other activities. Sims in certain moods can do extra things, not just with other Sims but with the world around them. This includes special paintings (there are WAY more options for painting now, in general), and getting embarrassed from sucking at playing an instrument (as well as making other sims &#34;tense&#34; because they suck). It helps make up for the lack of traits (still mad about that though, I'll be honest) and I think it could be fun as you get further on.<br /><br />Overall, I think Sims 4 is a solid game. I haven't been tempted to go back to Sims 3, which I kept installed just in case, and I don't find myself fast-forwarding through everything or cheating to keep my Sims from freaking out and having low needs. I only have the base game at the moment, but I've probably added 100 items via mods. The expansions are cheaper this time around, it seems, but I'm entertained enough to wait. I know a lot of people are pissed about Sims 4, but Istill think it's worth playing and trying. A lot of people were pissed about Sims 3 as well. People just hate change, especially gamers. That being said, I think I would still encourage you to wait for a price drop or an Origin sale, since it's a lot less frustrating to buy a $35 game and think, this is okay but I wish it had more, and paying $60-70 for a game and thinking the same thing.",2015-08-29

At first I was not sure I was going to get this, since I have already played the game on Xbox 360 in 2007. If you are wondering if enough is different to justify the purchase, well yes there is. The game still has that gritty dark look that so many people liked about the series. I know a lot of the early videos made the game look a lot brighter than the original. This actually is not how GOW Ultimate is. I repeat it is very dark and gritty.<br /><br />One thing I do not like is the computer intelligence of your comrades is just as stupid if not more stupid then the original game. You basically just play the game by yourself. The computer controlled partners will run right out and get shot and are useless. Also I really would have liked if they would have thrown in a version of Horde in the game. I know Horde did not debut until the second game, but it has a huge following. I cannot wait until GOW 4.",2015-08-29

You open the box and inside is a very nice controller case. Open that and you have a controller slot with some nice foam to keep your controller safe on the lid portion are two mesh pockets with a Velcro portion to keep everything tidy very nice case. The braided cable is of good length, and plugs in nice and easy. The controller is plug and play into pc which is what I am using it for. So first issue the backlit button are cheap crap. The buttons don't cover the whole slot so the light just shines straight out. Yes, it has a function to turn them off, but in messing with this option I came across problem 2. Access option to turn backlight off then go turn off rumble since I don't like rumble pressing the button to switch turns the backlight back on. So after messing around with it a bit, gave up on having both backlight and rumble turned off. Moved on trying to play the game I wanted it for Tera. This is a game I play with a controller that has to compete with people who use keyboards and mouse. So I was trying to keep playing with a controller, so for instance if I have block mapped to right mouse button and click the character will block as fast as I can click. The problem with controller is that they have that depress time was hoping this razer wouldn't. It has less depress than my xbox one controller, but the button are not very quick to respond so despite spamming B to block I block once every 2 seconds. This Is not very conducive at all considering especially in PvP I have to unblock rotate my character and re-block to block an attack coming from a different direction rapidly. So that's pretty much a right off for me but I'll continue. The thumb-sticks are very slow as well I play with max sensitivity on this game and it felt like I had cut my sensitivity in half. So again in PvP well changing camera angles and character direction needs to be rapid, I don't need a controller that lets people run circles around me faster than I can turn. Now for this &#34;ergonomic&#34; design the part of the controller on the outside part of the bumpers pushes outward physically making it harder to push the bumpers. I normally can use the bumper and trigger with just one finger on xbox one/360 and PS4 controller but this one was making me fight it to do that do to its bad design, also made that extra set of bumper they put into the controller very difficult to get at. This controller feels cheap overall like some knockoff. So poor buttons, bad programming  in the panel, terrible thumb-sticks and horribly ergonomic design controller, that came in a very nice case with a nice cable. I will stick with my xbox one controller.",2015-08-29

They didn't even include a stage from Sonic Heroes, though I suppose the Special Stages and stage select soundtrack make up for it...I guess. One thing both versions of the game did do right however was using Chemical Plant Zone and Casino Night Zone from Sonic 2 as in my opinion those were the best, memorable stages of that game. The rival battles here were meh...not really special to me and the Time Eater boss I have to admit was less frustrating than the 360 version.<br /><br />The stages are lush and beautiful especially Casino Night, Tropical Resort and Emerald Coast. A nice memory of my Sonic Adventure DX days making me wish that they ported Sonic Adventure to the GBA or DS. 2D stages of that game would've been interesting.<br /><br />If Sega decides to do another Generations game during Sonics 25th or 30th anniversary I'd want a full 3D version of the original classic Sonic the Hedgehog.<br /><br />Like most reviews here the game can be beaten in a few hours but Mission mode will surely keep players coming back. I've finished all missions and got S rankings in every stage so there's not much else for me to do then to improve my profile card. Pick this game up if you're a Sonic fan and want to relive those days of the Genesis and Dreamcast/Gamecube. Or else watch the playthrough videos on youtube to see how the game plays.",2015-08-28

I normally hate big clunky things like these (which is why I was always like nahhh when it came to buying so Beats by Dre) but these don't make me annoyed or make me feel like it's suffocating me with its size at all. I can almost barely tell it's there. The cushion on the top of the band rests nicely on top of your head giving you even more room to breathe and adjusts perfectly so that the headset stays in place. Because you know, like I know, that sometimes when games get really intense you do a lot of laughing or head movement as you're yelling at the screen. Yeah, with this, it's not going anywhere so no more of that &#34;crap! I just dropped my headset hold on. HEY WAIT UP!&#34; moments. I know you know what I'm talking about!<br /><br />The sound quality is awesome but I still would prefer the surround sound effect that my boyfriend's white ones give out. Headphones. With surround sound. It's about as mind blowing as it sounds guys. Forreal! I do however like the sound quality that comes with these when it comes to simple MMORPG gaming. I've always played my games on mute (I'm one of those people) so to actually HEAR what's behind you? It's crazy for me. Now I see why people use headsets to play COD!<br /><br />I like the options this product gives you. There are a few simple clicks of the middle button to control you music as far as back, pause and forward. No need to grab your phone to switch the song, it's awesome. Now if only they included voice command, could you imagine?! Talk about #lazygamer right?!<br /><br />Cons --- It doesn't flash crazy colors like I thought it would. But that's okay, it would probably distract me.

It plugs into a Wii Remote and can be used with both the Wii and Wii U on the menu and in games (assuming the game in question is compatible). Naturally, the designs are designed around Smash Bros. characters, and this controller definitely feels right in that game, as it has since Melee.<br /><br />The build quality is top-notch, but if you've ever bought a HORI controller, that's kind of old news to you. The plastic on the controller is matte finished, rather than the glossy finish of real GameCube controllers. It makes the controller feel slightly different than a real GC controller, but it still feels great. The ZL and ZR buttons are actual buttons, not triggers like the L and R buttons were on the GameCube, which could be a bit of a downer for some. That said, an L button was added to even out the controller.<br /><br />The controller has a turbo function, but I've never really gotten into using turbo for games. The sticks are tight and pleasant to use, with little resistance. They, as with the plastic on the controller, are a different material, but still feel good. The buttons go down easily and seem to use a mechanism identical to the old GC pads - so it's not likely to stick. Finally, the D-pad blows the real GameCube's D-pad out of the water. It's much larger than a GameCube D-pad and feels an awful lot like the D-pad you can find on the Wii U GamePad, but smoother. Since the GamePad has one of my favorite D-pads, this is a very good thing.<br /><br />It is more versatile than the Wii U Pro Controller at half the price - as a Classic Controller, not only can it be used with compatible Wii U games, it can also play games through the Wii Menu and can be used with actual original Wii hardware without extra setup - I've used this controller for playing Super Smash Bros. Brawl and it feels just as great as it does in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U.<br /><br />Overall, there's nothing negative I can say about this controller. It exceeds expectations, it feels great, and it brings a familiar controller layout to a new generation of games.",2015-08-28

(known as Ratchet & Clank: Tools of Destruction in Europe and Australia and Ratchet & Clank Future in Japan) was developed by Insomniac Games, and was released on October 23, 2007 for the PlayStation 3. This was the first Ratchet and Clank game for the PlayStation 3, and the first in the Future trilogy. In this installment, the self-proclaimed crown prince of the Cragmites known as Emperor Tachyon is after Ratchet, claiming that he is the last Lombax in the universe. He and Clank escape to the Polaris Galaxy, befriending the Markazian Talwyn Apogee and two old war bots named Cronk and Zephyr, who help the two uncover the Lombax secret, Tachyon's ultimate goal. Throughout the game, Clank encounters a mysterious race called the Zoni, who assist him at various points in the game, only to abduct him during the ending cut scene.<br /><br />Tools of Destruction's weapon upgrade system introduces the need for Raritanium, an aptly-named rare resource mentioned in previous games, in exchange for certain upgrades, as well as continuous use of said weapons to upgrade them automatically.",2015-08-28

However, the side buttons merely toggle the key, even when held in.  So if your play style is to crouch by holding C, you're going to crouch and come back up immediately, even if you're holding in the side button.<br /><br />I purchased this mouse exactly 1 year and 11 months ago today.  Within the first 3 weeks I had an issue with the laser not tracking correctly.  The mouse would move in unintended directions on the screen.  I wrote the company and they replaced the mouse with a new one.<br /><br />Since then, it's done the job.  Granted, I was trying to save a buck at the time, so I settled for this guy.  It feels like a mid-grade mouse.  However, within the past few weeks, I've noticed that my right mouse button does not register as well as it used to.  Now I'm an avid FPS gamer, I probably play 3-5 hours per week, and occasionally I'll play an MMORPG.<br /><br />The Right mouse button failures are most noticeable when sniping, the failure has robbed me of numerous kills and has even caused me to die several times.<br /><br />Also, the scroll wheel seems to cry or squeal every time I use it now.<br /><br />Basically, this mouse was good while it lasted, but don't expect it to last too long.

I really only have two gripes, and I'm sure if you play this game then you will agree with me.<br /><br />1. Menu for multiplayer - This game has a multiplayer menu that jumbles everything together. I was hoping that you could go to a separate matchmaking lobby for each game - go to a lobby and pick Halo 2 snipers or rumble pit playlist. This is not the case. There is one lobby and the gametypes you can pick are must much more limited - you can pick slayer and that includes Halo 2 and Halo 3 maps. I would have really liked if there would have been a main menu that allowed to select Halo, Halo 2, Halo 3 or Halo 4 and from there went to the same menu you could expect from each respective game. This leads to...<br /><br />2. Controls! - I never thought about it, but the controls changed from Halo 2 to Halo 3 and even to Halo 4. You can't just use the legacy controls for each game. They created a new &#34;Universal&#34; default that just doesn't quite provide the one size fits all that they intended it for. Sure, there are several variations but none of them work well with all of the games (grenade switching..deploying items). I can't believe they don't just let you customize the controls for exactly how you want them. It's not a big deal, just a little annoying.<br /><br />All in all, these aren't two huge issues that should prevent you from getting the game.

US,35773752,R2K9EHP4FGN79U,B00IZAF9GM,277815626,IA/VT -COLORFUL-,Video Games,5,14,14,N,N,"Fun, Demanding and Satisfying. Great music too.","- Introduction -<br /><br />IA/VT Colorful is a recently released Japanese music game for PS Vita. It probably won't ever be released in the West, according to producer Kenichiro Takaki, so if you want to play it, import it. The menus use lots of English and there is no story to follow, so knowledge of Japanese is not necessary at all. The game is massive, featuring 60 full-length songs, all sung by a vocaloid named IA (pronounced &#34;eee-yah&#34;).<br /><br />- My Background -<br /><br />I am coming to this game much more as a general music game fan than as a Vocaloid music fan. I am a big fan of music games, my favorites being DDR (back in the PS1 era) and Elite Beat Agents (NDS). I've also played a decent amount of Guitar Hero, Rock Band, DJ MAX and Bit.Trip Runner2. But I've only played a short demo of Hatsune Miku Project Diva f and I don't know much about Vocaloids. (Although this game is slowly changing that!)<br /><br />- Gameplay -<br /><br />The gameplay is easy to understand and fun. There are 8 different face button notes and special &#34;colorful notes&#34; which are triggered by any button and boost the score multiplier. I really like that there are no touch controls at all, which I have always found kind of gimmicky in music games. The goal is to try to max your combo and get as many &#34;Cool&#34; note scores as possible, and it's quite a rush to finally succeed and get the ultimate SSS and Perfect Combo rankings on a song.<br /><br />On a technical level, the game is really solid. The note scoring system (Cool/Nice/Safe/Miss for each note) is tight and balanced. And thanks to the great visual and sound design, you get really great feedback on your timing, if you are early, late or missed it. In comparison, it seems like a lot of music games don't give good feedback on your timing. These games are either frustrating to play or unsatisfying because they introduce sloppier scoring systems to compensate. So I am really impressed that IA/VT pairs a demanding scoring system with such great feedback. This makes improving your skill easier and more satisfying than many other music games.<br /><br />I started playing on Normal in &#34;Free Play&#34; mode. It seemed a little too easy at first, but the challenge ramped up really nicely as I unlocked songs, with lots of fun tricks and fast notes to keep me on my toes. It was a nice touch that the last unlocked songs on Normal difficulty have about the same challenge as the first songs on Hard difficulty. The challenge keeps progressing up to the final songs on Hard, which are all rated 9/10 or 10/10 for challenge.<br /><br />There is also &#34;Step Up Play&#34; mode, which is essentially a campaign mode where each level gives you a specific song (or 2 or 3 songs in a row), applies a modifier (like random or hidden notes) and you are challenged to get at least S ranking, or a certain number of &#34;Cool&#34; notes. This was pretty fun and gets quite tricky too!<br /><br />- Graphics -<br /><br />Overall this game looks absolutely stellar. It's hard to even think of a single ugly thing in it. The UI is incredibly polished and even the default note skins look fantastic. I'm not even sure that Persona 5, when it comes out, will have better looking UI than this game.<br /><br />Regarding the songs themselves, most have video animations or slideshows going on in the background, ranging from meh to awesome. Some songs you can play with costumes and 3D animations, which are cool but mainly just show IA staring out into space while walking or standing and not lip-syncing to the song. From what I've seen, Project Diva f has way higher quality song animations, but this was never really a selling point of the game for me and I think it is perfectly fine the way it is.<br /><br />- Music -<br /><br />I think this music is pretty cool on the whole. I've played every song at least 2 or 3 times now and most of them keep growing on me. I really like indie-rock and post-rock kind of stuffand a lot of these songs felt inspired by this kind of music. Lots of wacky, interesting rhythms. Lots of pop, electronic and metal elements. The Vocaloid singing is obviously all digital, but many of the backing guitars and drums sound like they were performed live by skilled musicians. This isn't the kind of stuff I ever imagined being in a music game, but I think it all works really well.<br /><br />Still, I'm left wondering who are the people who are making these songs? I looked into one song I liked called Migawari Kibonnu. Between Youtube and Nicovideo, the song's PV has gotten around 35,000 views total over two years. This seems like an absurdly small number of views for something cool enough to be put into a video game. The song's creator was Manabe Shuichi, a mysterious person who plays bass in the band Soutaisei Riron (literally &#34;Theory of Relativity&#34;), produces for a young female singer named Hanae, and plays in the self-described &#34;brutal orchestra&#34; music collective Vampillia. I still don't even know what he looks like, but these other projects seem just as interesting and unusual as this one song that he contributed to IA Project. I suspect the backstories for the other 59 songs in this video game are probably pretty similar to this as well, which I think is pretty cool. The subculture of Japanese music represented by this game seems to be both incredibly rich and very mysterious at the same time.<br /><br />- Replayability -<br /><br />Like most music games, there's tons of replayability here. Each song is about 5 mins long on average, so with 60 songs included, there's around 5 hours of music to play in this game. That's a lot! With three difficulty levels, as well as a separate campaign mode, it takes around 20 hours to do everything in the game once. Replaying and mastering songs you like is of course fun too. The Platinum trophy seems like a pretty reachable goal, although maybe a little grindier than just playing the game for fun.I'm currently working on this myself. Getting the Platinum will probably take the average player around 25-30 hours and involves playing each song in the game several times, as well as playing through extra songs for each of the 59 unlockable costumes.<br /><br />- Final Thoughts -<br /><br />+ Really satisfying to play thanks to the tight scoring system and great timing feedback.<br />+ Impressive visual presentation.<br />+ Interesting and slightly unusual music for a rhythm game.<br /><br />- Much smaller budget than Project Diva games.<br />- Some songs (not many) are boring or just not very fun.<br />- Not enough higher difficulty songs.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a really fantastic music game. It does a lot of things right, such that I feel like all of my complaints are pretty minor. I really can't put my PS Vita down, which is just like when I was playing P4G all over again. If you just like all kinds of music games, this one is definitely worth your time. More so than your Rock Bands and Guitar Heros if you have the slightest leaning towards Japanese music. If you like Project Diva games, I'm no expert, but I think this one is worth your time too. You might love the music, or you might not, but you will probably at least like the music enough to really enjoy the high quality of gameplay included within.",2015-08-28

Compared to other turtle beach headsets, and specifically for use with the PC, they don't stack up (compatibility with PC mainly... they weren't just instantly recognized like most products made for PC. Also, compared to other turtle beach headsets, the comfort and sound quality isn't as good). That's the relative portion of the review I guess. However, I am completely satisfied and I still love these things. Compared to most other brands, they are much better.

Clever challenges, lots of time wasted completing side quests, and that warm feeling I'd get jumping back into the LOTR universe (particularly Howard Shore's utterly sublime score). That said, I'm extremely disappointed in Warners for dropping the ball on this game and not completing it. If I cared enough to do some research, I'm sure I'd find a rational explanation for not including the levels corresponding to the third movie, but the fact is that they went back on their word and ultimately failed to deliver closure to this game. I should have known something was up before I purchased it and found that only two movies were covered, but their official assurances that the final levels would be available to download shortly after was good enough for me. Well, I guess in the future I'll be that much more hesitant to take WB's word for it, and simply wait for them to deliver a complete product, or just spend my money somewhere else. 5 stars for the gameplay (avoid PS3 version: EXTREMELY BUGGY, while PS4 hasn't crashed once), but subtract 3 stars for selling incomplete product under false pretenses and thus far failing to make amends.<br /><br />(Accompanying photos include me as I was playing it the first time, followed by Warner Bros. announcement in March that it won't be releasing the last installment via DLC.

People tell me to just plug in iPhone headphones but when I did that the mic didn't appear to be working. Then I used a y-splitter and connected an xlr mic to a USB interface with a live monitor headphone out and used regular headphones. The quality of that setup was probably superior, but the Sony wireless set doesn't have me tangled up in cables. I wish there was a better way to keep it charged, it sucks when you're in a dungeon or battle and the headset beeps to indicate a low battery, and then shortly afterwords you can't communicate with your team. Or when you're hunched awkwardly out on the edge of the couch at the limit of your USB cable trying to be plugged in and using the headset at the same time. From a full charge it lasts a fair amount of time, but it could possibly be a more elegant power solution and allow some external battery or something.<br />The sound for the headset is decent but mic level is problematic. I was playing online and could hear my echo from other players, I held the ps button in like I used to for my jacked in setup and found no mic level adjustment to check how loud I was. I discovered that I could do it from the dashboard if I exited my game, but it couldn't be adjusted mid game.

This game is great...awesome story (very believable, too), great cutscenes (terrible graphics, but that's how it was for the time), and ok combat.  I had to take off one star for the following reasons:<br /><br />1)  The combat.  It's just ok...sometimes the controls stick and it's tough to get up from a crawl and Snake sometimes backs up against walls you didn't mean him to back up onto.  The aiming can take a bit to get used to as well.<br /><br />2)  You will die....A LOT....the game is not very easy on the &#34;easy&#34; setting either.  The worst part is that you have to go through all the cutscenes again if you die during a boss encounter.  Very, very annoying.<br /><br />and lastly,<br /><br />3)  The Psycho Mantis battle is AWFUL, but only if you got this game off PSN on the PS3.  The controller port switching doesn't work at all, and it takes a good half hour or so to kill him.  You'll find the battle to be very frustrating because of this.  I don't understand why this happens, but after performing a search for the issue online, it's clearly well documented.  I don't know why they haven't fixed it.<br /><br />In any case, the game deserves 5 stars for setting the benchmark for all future games to follow it, but the above concerns are worthy of a 1-star deduction.",2015-08-28

No dumb downed ports, no on multiple platforms, this game was made for ps4 and it shows!  Until Dawn is a virtual movie. If you've played games like Heavy Rain, Beyond Two Souls, Until Dark takes a bit from those games and utilizes the controls from those. Gameplay isn't the focus here, it comes down to the amazing story and your decision making.  The characters are lively, interesting, and the story is awesome.  You take control of multiple characters and you gain clues to solve things along the way. You make split second decisions that will affect the outcome of every situation and can also affect how the game ends. Starting out I thought the game itself was a little slow. But the introduction of the characters was required for you to really get attached to them and know each of their motives and stories. But the story really picks up and I was glued within no time!  The graphics are stunning in this game. Some of the best I've seen on ps4 so far.  Really struts out some nice visuals. My wife and I played it together and she was like &#34;man that looks so real&#34;  It really does look like a virtual movie.<br /><br />On a whole, this is one of my favorite ps4 games right now. Unique, great story, interseting characters and you won't want to put the controller down. I beat the game in about  8 hours. I find it to be quite worth your time and money. I hope maybe to see some added DLC in the future? Maybe some new episodes? Have fun! And God bless to all who read this.",2015-08-28

I'm more of a gameplay guy and my ...,"I'm going to keep this review short and sweet. I'm more of a gameplay guy and my review will be based on that area. Madden 16 by far offers the best overall gameplay experience in the history of the franchise. Some of my favorite additions are as follows:<br /><br />New passing mechanics, new catching mechanics and options, DB/WR interactions, new DB play ball/play receiver mechanics, Organic and gang tackling, QB AI, improved locomotion on the controlled player, ratings being more of a factor, defensive holding and defensive PI. These gameplay additions help Madden 16 to march closer towards to the simulation game I have been waiting for EA Sports to produce. I would also like to add Draft Champions, great mode in my opinion. I don't normally play MUT and DC gives me the ability to play with a fantasy team without any real commitment. At the very most you can play with the same team 4 times, after that it's back to the drawing board. I love suspense factor of always having to build a new team.<br /><br />Of course there are still things left to do and the game still has a few issues which are listed below.<br /><br />I would like to see little to no warping and motion shifting into place.<br />Animation Quality, which the Devs have mentioned themselves. Just want the animations and player movement to look and feel more natural. At times the game still lacks the fluidity that you see in other sports titles.<br />22 Man Physics, I would like to see the physics run at all times and have an affect on every aspect of the game.<br />Physics driven injuries.<br />Signature Animations and Signature Skills for players. I would start with the biggest stars in the league and build from that.<br />New Ratings System, I would like to see position specific ratings and more skill based traits.<br />Jersey pulls and real reach tackles<br />Outside of that I would just like to see the Devs build on what's already in the game as well. Continue to clean up known issues and build on the foundation you already have set in place.<br /><br />I am also a big CFM player and I will mention that briefly. I like the new scouting system, dynamic goals, storyline commentary including drive starters, and the addition to free practice. I still think there is so MUCH more that could be done in this area to make the game more immersive. There needs to be more off-field activities such has developing storylines that affect game day, contract disputes, chemistry, performance hits for players not practicing, real life draft board, etc. I could go on for days.<br /><br />Madden 16 gives me confidence that the Devs want to get Madden to an elite level. I'm already waiting to see what Air Supremacy looks like in it's second year. If the Devs continue on the path they have going on since Madden 25 I think we have a lot to look forward to. The future looks bright.",2015-08-28

Ryu, Ken, Charlie, Chun Li, Rose M Bison, Birdie, Sagat, Sodom, Gen, Guy & Dan. You have new additions like Rolento from Final Fight. They brought back Zangief & Dhalsim & a new character Sakura is now part of Street Fighter.  The game has the same idea as Street Fighter Alpha as whoever you play you don't fight M Bison at the end like if you play Ryu you fight Akuma at the end & this is the 1st time Ryu & Akuma fought. If you play as Ken you'll fight Ryu at the end. If you playthrough as Sagat then you'll fight Ryu. If you play as M Bison you'll face Ryn. If you fight as Akuma you'll face Gen. If you play as Charlie then you'll fight Bison. I am going through people I just prefer playing as. The game feels to me a more difficult I mean about a week ago 1 night I was playing as Sagat & I probably lost to Ryu nearly 10 times. That could be cause I haven't played this game in like 5 years although when I played again I still lost to Ryu mayabe 1 to 3 times but hey I liked it the last couple of fights they add a challenge to even on the most easiest so I'm glad they did that where even if you play on the easiest difficulty the last couple of battles become challenging & you'll have to play defensively & know when to strike. You'll need to know when to trip or when to do a jump attack. Plus you have special moves as well as super moves that were added back when Super Street Fighter II Turbo came out. The gameplay is great the graphics are really good & playing it on the Sega Saurn they look great especially if you can get it to output S Video then do it as it adds more depth & color on screen. The sound & music is really good. So if you are interested in Street Fighter & getting into fighting games then The Alpha series is the best way to start imo. It was available in Arcades originally so if you see it in an arcadethen give it shot. On The Saturn it's more costly these days I got my copy off of The Street Fighter Collection that has Super Street Fighter II & Super Street Fighter II Turbo it was under the name Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold. But you can get this game on The PS2 as part of The Alpha Anthology & it's downloadable on PS3 & 360 as well on MAME. So if you like fighting games there's no reason not to play this cause it's a fun game. Next review will be for X Men vs Street Fighter which is the best home port of that game.",2015-08-28

My biggest gaming surprise in 34 years of being a gaming nerd.,"I have been gaming since 1981 when my parents bought me an Atari 2600 for Christmas.  And in all that time, Until Dawn is easily the biggest surprise I have ever had in a game.  And what a wonderful surprise it is.<br />The game gets it all right.  I am not usually a fan of these type of &#34;adventure&#34; games.  I usually prefer to truly &#34;play&#34; the game.  But the whole adventure game thing is perfect for Until Dawn.  I never feel like the game is playing itself and I am just a spectator.  The controls are simple enough for the most part, that even someone new to games or the PS4 controller will be able to play with the minimum of frustration.  And even though the story is full of horror movie cliches (which I believe is the point), the story and characters are keeping me glued to my seat.  A chapter ends and I am worried...is so-and-so still alive?  I can't wait for the next chapter to start.  I am also a horror movie geek.  I love horror movies, but I am a snob.  I think 90% of horror movies are garbage and I tend to stay far away from horror movies that show up at the local cineplex.  And that was one of my main issues before I bought the game.  It is basically a playable horror movie...as the game makers will say in the bonus features, a playable &#34;teen&#34; horror movie.  Well I loved teen horror when I was a teen, but that was long ago.  I had no reason to worry.  The whole teen horror aspect works perfectly here and playing the game actually has me thinking I should check out some of these horror flicks I wrote off without giving them a chance.<br />I have also played many games lately that are full of very annoying design choices or super frustrating mechanics.  Often it feels like game designers hate me.  Not here.  Nothing but love here.<br />The voice acting is uniformly excellent.  The graphics are quite nice.  And the atmosphere is killer.  Thick and heavy and perfect.<br />I always get annoyed when I hear a game is made to be played multiple times.  I think that is a cop out.  If you can't give me everything in one play, that is a failure.  But this game begs for a second, third, and beyond play through.  I actually can't wait to play more.  Can I save that character I lost the first time?  Can I get that idiot who I hate killed this time?  My only problem is Metal Gear Solid V comes out in 4 days....gonna cram this weekend full of Until Dark.<br />I guess if I had to give a quick &#34;review&#34; of this game I would say that everything comes together perfectly in it.  If you love adventure games, but it.  If you horror movies, buy it.  If you are looking for a rip roaring fun time, buy it.  if you want to play a game that makes you scream and then makes me smile like you haven't smiled since you were a kid, buy it.  Just buy it...there is a lot of love in this game.  And even more fun.",2015-08-28

Also, there is a manufacturing defect in ALL of these where the power button is loose, causing it to rattle every time you move your head.<br /><br />First of all set up is a nightmare. The instruction manual (read cover to cover) is lacking any substantive information, and if you're on a PC a working mic set up is NOT included, you need to buy and install a separate bluetooth adapter in order to talk to people (somehow two way communication was an after thought when developing this gem). Secondly it has a lot of technical issues: the headset shuts down every ten minutes while gaming. I looked into it and it's a &#34;feature&#34; where the headset shuts down if it's not detecting any headset or mic sound...However this would happen mid sentence, mid game so it basically does what it wants.<br /><br />It serves as a hundred dollar pair of ear warmers, and that's about it.",2015-08-28

You cannot save your progress but must depend on &#34;save points&#34; at specific places during the game. This fates you to having to play the same mission over and over and over and over... until (if) you succeed. Due to the tedium of having to repeat the same missions I set the game play to &#34;easy&#34; just so I could accomplish any forward movement through the game.<br /><br />Worse is that if you die, the game throws you back at some random origination point on the map. This requires you drive/run/walk over huge stretches of territory just to get back to the point on the map where you last died in order to continue.<br /><br />Another time I fought my way through a mission but needed to log out of my computer. I thought it would save my progress to that point so I could pick up where I left off. Nope, I had to play through the entire mission, including waiting through those agonizingly long cut scenes again.<br /><br />The game punishes you for playing it; the tedium of repetition of missions and the extent one must go through to get back to where you were should you die, is a huge disincentive for me.<br /><br />The other issue are the graphics; I cannot afford to buy the latest, fastest computer every time a new games comes out. I actually have a two year old &#34;gamer PC&#34; and Nvidia video card, yet I had to set the graphics on the lowest level or the game was too stuttering (laggy) to be playable.<br /><br />And don't even get me started on having to have to log into UPlay to even open the game.<br /><br />It was fun up to a point then the frustration of repetition and tedium has taken it's toll.

It's shares a lot in common with F1 Championship Edition on PS3 which is also a stellar F1 game I recently got.<br /><br />This game is already one of the best racing games on PSP by far IMO. F1 2009 and F1 2011 are absolute trash compared to this game and its a real shame because I'd prefer to play on my Vita but the physics of those games are just awful and clunky.<br /><br />F1 2006 on the other hand plays almost perfectly. Realistic but intuitive physics and well configured for the PSP even if you turn all the driver assists off. It also has car damage, weather effects, and the coolest implementation of pit stops in any game I've.<br /><br />Another great thing about this game and F1 CE on PS3 is the classic F1 cars. There are several classic F1 cars you can unlock in this game which really makes it more interesting to play than Codemasters F1 series. Also, you can unlock the Jerez track as well. The F1 cars you don't have to unlock are the Lotus 72E and the Cooper CLimax. Through time trial mode, quick race, and championship or career mode you can also unlock the Lotus 49c, a 80's williams, a 90's williams, and a 50's alfa romeo (I could be a little off but I'm pretty sure these are the cars)<br /><br />It also has an interesting career mode where you have to prove yourself to get a seat in an F1 car because much like in real life, you start as a test driver.<br /><br />The only negatives are the graphics (still pretty good for a PSP game) and the way the game handles your steering inputs. To make steering less twitchy, they've made it slightly gradual so when you go left on the d pad or stick, it doesn't go all the way to full lock instantly sending you into a spin. The only problem is it takes a little getting used to and I wish there was an option to adjust it a little bit but otherwise this game is amazing.<br /><br />The best part about this game is the physics and the racing. The AI is actually really challenging even on medium difficulty and they're also decent to race with. They don't constantly crash into like other games and they're not afraid to pass you",2015-08-28

This is the worst madden I have played, and I severely regret paying 60 dollars for this. Here are some things I dislike after playing several games.<br /><br />1) Nantz and Simms are back for more stale recycled commentary. Love the use of pronouns when announcing. Or generic position names. Other game commentary (like NBA2k) is so much better than this, cmon EA<br />2) Holy glitches and bugs. Connected franchise has frozen or disconnected in the middle of a game several times. Announcers comment over and over how an injured player has returned (literally every play). Also google &#34;Ghost interception&#34;. Do they even test this game?<br />3) New catch styles are dumb. Aggressive catch is so unrealistic and OP.<br />4) If you are a QB in Connected franchise, you have to play on Zoom camera which is awful. Thanks for taking away the customization EA.<br />5) New throwing mechanics are awful. My 80 qb cannot hit wide open guys. Using the left stick for placement is useless and the new buttons for throwing high and low are quite counterintuitive<br />6) Fantasy draft was so dumb. Jamaal Charles, a top 5 rb, went in the 5th round.<br />7) The bubbles that pop up saying for example &#34;20 yard return&#34; look so bad.<br /><br />Maybe this game will grow on me, and I will updated accordingly, but this game is just not a fun time to play. Save your money for NBA2k when it comes out",2015-08-28

Until Dawn is a delightfully cheesy horror themed suspense game that's full of tough decisions and intense moments. The story & plot are fantastic and the outcome depends on the choices you make. Its like watching an interactive movie, if you don't like QTE (Quick Time Events) then this game may not appeal to you. This game startled the HECK outta me many times, and despite its slower paced nature, it was a complete thrill. I enjoyed the moderate horror level, it was not extreme like P.T. (P.T. is the most terrifying game I've ever played, I literally couldn't finish it). I beat it multiple times to find all the collectibles, make different choices, get all trophies and change fate for a different ending. Below is my opinion on the Pros and Cons.  Pros: -Best graphics for any PS4 game to date -Breathtaking atmosphere & beautiful scenery -Great story and interesting plot -Brutal outcomes based on your decisions -Great sound effects & setting music, play this game with headphones! -Character relationship status changes depending on actions -Surprisingly NOT predicable ending/plot -Moderate replay value with alternate endings -Get your friends together and grab the popcorn, make a whole night of playing this. Much like in horror movies, the characters here will do something stupid that'll make you yell at your TV. The only difference is you'll also be screaming at yourself for the things YOU did!  Cons: -Game is rather short -Very slow movement speed... You can hold &#34;L1&#34; to walk like 10% faster but its still slow. From a &#34;glass is half-full&#34; perspective, the result of this causes you to appreciate the unique camera angles and beautiful scenery much more because you're not quickly running past everything. -Some decisions result in the same outcome regardless of what you choice... kind of pointless. That being said, there are plenty of difficult choices in the game that DO actually matter and ARE important. -Unskippable cut-scenes on second playthroughs. For this game I can understand why, because you may get a QTE prompt at ANY moment, so you have to stay tuned in. However this could get annoying during multiple playthroughs, which seems to be ideal for this type of game. I suspect that between this and the slow movement speed, the intention was to add X hours on a play-through so it seems longer.  I don't usually buy DLC, but I hope they make some for Until Dawn. Despite my elaboration on the cons, the PROS far outweigh the Cons, no contest. I give this a solid 8/10. I look forward to a squeal.",2015-08-28

I am very happy that I purchased this Fit in Six game with motion controller. I've been using this game every day since receiving it. Surprisingly, I have not been very sore the day after doing the workouts, which motivates me to continue with the program. It's easy to operate once you get used to the Move controller. I recommend a yoga mat and some space to move about. You can do most of the moves in a smaller space if you live in an apartment though. This game has realistic instructors to follow, fairly clear instructions, and lots of encouragement. There is a variety of goals to choose from which the game has specific classes to take to reach each goal. Once you reach a goal, you can choose another one. It doesn't take forever to reach a goal, which gives me a sense of accomplishment and desire to complete more goals. The classes are mostly between 5-15 minutes, so you can do several in a sitting if you want. I already feel like I am seeing results from doing this everyday.",2015-08-28

This adds intrigue in finding more out about them as the game progresses.<br />- The combat system was like nothing I've ever played before which was nice. It fallows the traditional turn based set up but its utterly in terms of which party members get to act first and even which skills you've unlocked for each can be used. In a sense you basically always have to make due with whatever you end up with which might sound bad when said aloud but it actually is rather fun ingame. Also during the middle of battles you can swap party members in and out with each other if you want. This actually will be key as some of the characters have elemental attacks that work best on various types of enemies.<br />- The game uses the traditional random encounter mechanic, where you'll be attack by monsters after you move around for a odd amount of time. However at least one of the characters can use a skill that scares monsters away for a set amount of time (this is helpful when your party is tired and needs to get back to the rest area without further complications. That much said another character has a skill that does the exact opposite using it will automatically trigger a battle (helpful when you're doing your standard RPG character level grinding as it save time having to walk around to attract attention).<br />- The mini games that are key to unlocking more of each character's skills and improving your relationship with them are interest, but be warned they are a tad bit lewd so if you're not comfortablewill doing so kinky stuff to girls of questionable ages I'd suggest you skip this game.<br />- Character Dialog is surprisingly well done for a game that was most likely banking on fan service.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The game can be unforgiving in fights in later areas to players who don't put in a lot of work leveling up all their party members and improving relationship levels with each as much as possible.<br />- The magic on the touch screen mini games might be lost on some players after the first few times and after that some players might just find it annoying.<br />- Having to use both the rear and front touch screens at the same time can be chore at best and nightmare at worst.<br />- Its really rare but some of the later mini games have been known to freeze the game due to how much they make your do at once.<br />- This might not be a con for everyone (personally I find it trivial) but there is no english audio only original Japanese at least not that I recall so get ready read all the dialog.<br /><br />Thats concludes my review, all and all its fun little game and bold release given how uptight Western media is about the sort of subject matter this game has a field day with outside of blatant porn but thats Western hypocrisy for you.",2015-08-28

You should have bought an X-Box One,"Were you excited by all the new features and changes mentioned all over the Internet, in previews and reviews, in videos everywhere?<br /><br />Too bad.  You should have bought an X-Box One.<br /><br />There is no new scouting system in Madden 16 on the X-Box 360.  Instead, you get the new points (fewer points, losing points if you sim ahead without scouting every week), but you get the old system with a bonus (I mean, other than the lack of points making it hard to skim the surface of a tiny number of players): It's bugged.  Every player shows Strength as &#34;fully scouted&#34; with a 0.  Which is just the kind of thing that really helps you figure out which offensive or defensive lineman you want to select!<br /><br />The new passing style might be there, but it's hard to tell at times, when passes seem to go anywhere but where you wanted them to.  There is a tutorial on it, though.<br /><br />Draft Champions is there, and that at least seems like an interesting way to play the game.  Is it worth $60 (or $70 for Deluxe Edition)?  Not at all.<br /><br />It's one thing to see minor changes from edition to edition with Madden.  We get that.  They remove features because it's easier to do that than develop them, or they can add them back later and pretend they're new (like owner mode).  But having an edition of the game where they manage to break more than they add while simultaneously having the &#34;same&#34; edition on another system with a lot more features?  We're getting into new territory here.<br /><br />If you have a 360, you've just been told you're an afterthought by EA.  Make them an afterthought in your own mind.  Don't buy this game on X-Box 360.",2015-08-28

This of course comes *after* struggling just to get the game to install completely as the first effort at installing got me to a &#34;Ready to Start&#34; that was then met with a &#34;This game needs an update&#34; before I could really start the game.  That took me through a loop of uninstalling the game which hadn't completely installed back through several attempts to get the game to completely install only to be met with &#34;There was an error installing...&#34; that could either have me Retry or Cancel the installation process.<br /><br />When I finally was able to complete the install (patience is definitely key as the process is slow and takes several minutes to get through (more like 15 - 20 minutes total) and actually start the game, I was, as noted, forced to sit through a intro story/movie that gives me a chance to hit a few buttons in key points to complete the play that was automatically called.  There is no way to exit that 'demo' that I could find, so again patience is required to sit back and get ready to actually play the game or enter the code that you might have to get you some additional content.  Once I did complete the opening story, I was then forced into yet more lessons of what has changed in the game or how to play the game, again with no way to exit to the main menu.  Seriously, EA (or their programmers) are that insistent that I have to sit through classes in how to play the game before they'll let me go to the main menu?  You can't offer say a &#34;Learn to play the game&#34; tutorial as a menu choice that would be available (but not forced upon the gamer) at the gamer's choice, rather you have to force the gamers into these tutorials as if they are totally incompetent at just putting the game in and starting to play?<br /><br />As a co-worker and I discussed about this, what happened to the good old days when you could just put the game in and hit the start button?  If the game is really that complex that it requires training and the training is really that different from one year to the next then something is fairly obviously wrong.  Perhaps the developers/publisher need to go back to the drawing board to remove some of the complexity and put back the fun that has been drained away thanks to these experiences.<br /><br />With that all said, I'm sure that fans of the game will love it and will likely trash my comments and call me a H8er.  The game has its fans and it certainly is continuing to be tweaked graphically as it has become one of the more realistic portrayals of athletes in a virtual environment.  It does look really nice, complete with a lot of serious eye candy.  The question is just how frustrated will you be trying to get to the point that you can just play one game?

What first started life as a Playstation Move game on the PS3, Until Dawn never released in that form and was instead scrapped and rebuilt from the ground up for the PS4 to emulate the style of game that developer Quantic Dream has been making for years now, namely Indigo Prophecy, Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls. However, unlike those titles, Until Dawn is a horror game. It's hard to find a direct comparison in video games when it comes to this style of horror. Many people might not have played it, but the closest thing I'd compare it to in terms of a horror game is Obscure from the 6th console generation. That was a teen horror game with all of the tropes that come with the genre. So if you've played Obscure, think of a better version of that married with Heavy Rain.<br /><br />In terms of gameplay, again, the closest comparison is Heavy Rain. You are exploring environments, finding clues, doing quick-time events during action scenes -- and these are done extremely well in this game and far more varied than in other games that offer them, etc. The gameplay is tied directly to the narrative to make it a cinematic and seamless experience. This isn't a game where you're just doing meaningless actions to pad a game's length, but each action services the storytelling.<br /><br />Graphically, Until Dawn is one of the best looking games out there. As someone who has all 3 current generation consoles, I haven't played many games on par with Until Dawn. Running on the Killzone: Shadow Fall engine, an engine capable of producing beautiful visuals, Until Dawn is a looker. However, that doesn't mean it's perfect as the framerate can chunk up in some areas, but these small issues are few & far between and it doesn't really tarnish the game's brilliance. Character model wise, these are some of the most detailed character models in any game, and these characters feel like real people, warts & all.<br /><br />In terms of being a horror game, Until Dawn isn't the scariest game you'll play -- it's a fun, campy, teen slasher -- but it still offers plenty of scares. So if you're a bit of a wimp when it comes to horror, don't worry. It's scary but not overly gross or terrifying.<br /><br />Please, please, please, if you have any interest in this game, pick it up. Remember, if you buy something and support it, it's more likely that we'll see more titles like this. If we don't support them, however, we won't, and that would be a shame. This is Supermassive Games debut, it's an interesting new IP, and it needs our support.<br /><br />To any employees of Supermassive Games: If you read this, thank you for the wonderful game that has been a treat for my spouse and I to experience together.ers feel like real people, warts & all.<br /><br />In terms of being a horror game, Until Dawn isn't the scariest game you'll play -- it's a fun, campy, teen slasher -- but it still offers plenty of scares.

Then after 3 days they come back and say I should cut the USB cable and send them a picture of it before they will send me a replacement. This is horrible Customer Service.

The Scroll wheel itself has a great feel to it and solid click<br />-Software - completely custom - can change DPI settings, color of logo, breathing rate, button settings, click and scroll speed, etc<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Even though this is ergonomic, it feels like it was made for Left handed people (I am right handed).

The game has Online Multiplayer and 4 player Co-Op featuring the use of drop-in/drop-out, offline/online gameplay. The game mainly focuses on this cooperative play.[8] Teammates can work together, even using weapons between players. Players can take control of Ratchet, Clank, Captain Qwark, and Dr. Nefarious. It was released on October 18, 2011.<br /><br />In Ratchet and Clank: All 4 One, Ratchet and Clank retire from their adventures as superheroes after the election of Captain Quark as the Galactic President. Dr. Nefarious tricks him into going to Luminopolis by telling him that he would have gotten a prize for his heroic acts. Quark invites Ratchet and Clank to come with him and, after arriving, they discover the ruse, but Dr. Nefarious brings a Light-Eating Z'Grute back to life. The Light-Eating Z'Grute gets out of Nefarious' control, however, and they all work together to stop it. After killing the Light-Eating Z'Grute, they get captured by a mysterious drone, but they break free thanks to a little Tharpod girl called Susie. After escaping, they realize they are on an unknown planet and that if they want to get back home, they will have to cooperate.",2015-08-28

These headphones are not made well at all. I can speak from experience because both my kids have them and have been through 3 pairs each. The functionality and sound are definitely great.The craftsmanship however here sucks. If you don't treat them like they're made of fine china then they will quickly degrade and break. The real problem is taking them on and off by pulling them outward away from the ears. This is because there is a real weak spot in the sides where the pivot hinge is. The plastic around the steel pins breaks and then it's all over. After buying two replacement pairs I smartened up and bought the replacement plan at Best Buy. Now I bring them back every few months for a new pair. That's the only way to own these. Seriously. I've attached photos to show the nature of the problem. Stay away.

I've played the first one, and I must say that this game is a vast improvement in so many ways! The controls and gameplay feel a lot more fluid, the sheer amount of weapons and items is impressive, and there's so much variety to be had that replay value is phenomenal! As vague as all this is, if you've played the first and enjoyed it, I highly recommend this. If you've played Dark Souls II and are curious is this enhancement is worth it, I have friends who have played it and will agree that it is a vast improvement and, with the addition of all DLC, say that this is well worth the price. If you're new to Dark Souls and wish to jump in here, I say this is as good a spot as any if you don't have any interesting in playing the first. The lore remains the same, but the story isn't connected (contradiction? you bet!) so you won't be missing much if you're just heading in.<br /><br />TL;DR -- Great game that's worth the price for new and returning players (DS1 & DS2).",2015-08-28

If you want high quality S-video you're going to have to spend more on a Monster S-Video cable or a Japanese import. If you're looking for a good cable for SNES, I would forget S-video and RGB (which is a hassle and expensive), and wait for the component cables from HD Retrovision to come out.  EDIT: I was very wrong in my review. What I was talking about when I mentioned &#34;checkerboarding&#34; and &#34;screen dooring&#34; were actually scanlines, which are completely normal on CRT TV's with svideo.

It is also known as Ratchet & Clank: Quest for Booty in most PAL regions and as Ratchet & Clank Future Gaiden: Kaizoku Dark Water no Hihou in Japan.<br /><br />Taking place where Tools of Destruction left off, the game focuses on Ratchet and Talwyn's search for Clank. After a number of encounters with the pirates introduced in Tools of Destruction, they finally manage to activate a device called the Obsidian Eye that allows communication with the Zoni. However, the machine can not be activated without a reusable black hole frozen in furion crystal, named the Fulcrum Star. Rusty Pete revives the dead pirates and gives Slag a new body. After Ratchet defeats Darkwater/Slag, he and Talwyn obtain the Fulcrum Star. Ratchet then activates the Obsidian Eye, and learns Clank's fate: the Zoni have him in a strange new place, where he is malfunctioning. The Zoni reveal that they have hired Dr. Nefarious to repair Clank. Ratchet sets off to rescue Clank, and the story ends with Rusty Pete narrating to the head of Slag, which survived the destruction of Darkwater.",2015-08-28

Picked these up straight from the Allure website.<br /><br />This particular model, the CODG4 has definitely gotten close to being the best pair of glasses I have found so far. I have about $300 worth of Gunnar's, a handful of the Gamma Ray glasses, a noscope (fake computer glasses, avoid) and another Allure model (broke, cheaply made).<br /><br />Pros<br />The quality of the frame is fantastic, it contours nicely around the eyes. Look good wearing them, which is a rarity with these types of glasses. Extremely lightweight.<br /><br />Cons<br />Lens quality is questionable, where most glasses feel smooth when wiping with a microfiber cloth...these feel rough. Could just be the coating applied to the surface. The coloration of the lens is still a bit more orange than the competition. (Gamma Ray, the cheapest on amazon, actually has the best tint so far, color looks correct).<br /><br />This is worth the cost. Well done Allure, please keep up with this kind of form factor and if you can upgrade the lens quality as well as reduce the tint... I would gladly pay even more for that what these are going for now.<br /><br />NOTE: The sleeve the glasses came with was not the one pictured above, but for an older pair they had featuring Black Ops 2.",2015-08-28

I like the new way you get to pick how the receiver catches the ball and how if you pay as the tackle on defense you gotta time the buttons right and you'll get a sack.  I always thought MUT was and awesome contribution to madden,  and I'm sure that the Draft Champions mode is good too.  The franchise mode allows you to gain experience through playing for your team.

This indicated the planned release date for the next installment of the series. Ratchet continues his search for Clank, Dr. Nefarious returns as an antagonist (primary or otherwise), and the game goes into more depth about what happened to the Lombaxes.<br /><br />The story and player's perspective alternates between Ratchet and Clank; Clank's side of the story involves him fixing time at the Great Clock, as well as learning to fulfill his destined role as the Great Clock's senior caretaker. Clank also learns that a Zoni named Orvus had created his soul. Ratchet's part in the story includes meeting another Lombax named General Alister Azimuth, an elder who turns out to be unintentionally responsible for their kind's downfall as he allowed Tachyon to use the Lombaxes' technology, and is intent on taking control of the Great Clock to rectify his mistakes. Qwark also assists Ratchet during the storyline and eventually goes alone to gather useful information for Ratchet.",2015-08-28

We have an XBox 360 as well as a Wii U, and I chose the Wii U version so we don't have to play split screen, which I find really annoying.<br /><br />I've played many other Lego video games, and this one works pretty much the same as the others.  The only unique aspect is that you can play as a dinosaur.  There also seems to be a lot more running around looking for things and less fighting with other characters than in the other Lego games (although you do have to knock out some pesky dinosaurs at times).  I found it kind of confusing figuring out how to get to all the parks, but that could just be me.<br /><br />My main complaint is the amount of bugs in this game, which really should have been taken care of before it was released. It completely froze several times during play.  Sometimes when you are playing a one player game, the other character just randomly changes on his own to another character or a dinosaur.  I was playing as T Rex when he got stuck inside a wall.  I found trying to make Billy Brennan glide to be very frustrating  Sometimes he would just not open his parachute, even though I was controlling him correctly.  Velociraptor can jump and pull bars, but you have to stand in just the right place to make this work, which can take a long time to find.<br /><br />Another quirk is that in many places you need to be a dinosaur to accomplish certain actions.  In Free Play mode, if you're standing too close to where you need to change to a dinosaur, you cannot switch to the dinosaur character.  You need to move some distance away.  Why?<br /><br />This is my least favorite Lego video game.  I would recommend waiting until the price drops to about $19.99 before buying, which shouldn't take too long.  Maybe they will fix some of the bugs by then.",2015-08-28

Started all the way back in 2008 as the successor to the long running Super Robot Wars Alpha, Z had some big honking galoshes to fill and looking back on it I think it did a good job. Z stumbled a little with some of Z2's decisions, and the decision to release on both portable and console has definitely constrained Banpresto, and there's some generally deserved grumbling about some of Banpresto's decisions vis a vis series and unit availabilities in this game, but at the end of the day Z3.2 is a worthy finale to this multiverse spanning Super Robot War.<br /><br />Make no mistake, this is the big one. Z3 Tengoku starts right at the ending of the previous Z3 game: Hibiki and the other heroes of Z-BLUE have won their final battles and have gathered to witness the end of the Time Prison on the Earth, and discover that a second Earth hanging in the sky over their world. However both their reverie and their confusion is short lived when the main forces of Sidereal arrive to invade the Earth having decided the time for subtly is at an end. With no pause for rest our heroes are once again caught in a massive conflict to decide the fate of not only the Earth but the very future of existence. There's barely a year left until the end of the universe, and arrayed against Z-BLUE are not only Sidereal but Amalgam, Neo Zeon, the Baal, the Gods of universes past, and of course the &#34;Angel&#34; that Hibiki has been ceaselessly pursuing. Along the way the 12 spheres will finally be gathered, the story of Asakim Doan will be told, the truth behind The Edel will be revealed, a reckoning will arrive for gods and for the people who would become them. The end of the universe is coming, and it's going to go out with a bang.<br /><br />If you've played a Super Robot Wars game made since the DS came out then Z3.2 will be a familiar experience. The fundamentals of the game remain the same, it's a Turn Based RPG with a linear progression of stages using a grid where you move your units and attack to fight your foes. It's Fire Emblem if Fire Emblem had giant robots instead of fantasy character. As usual for non-OG games the bulk of you army is culled from quite an array of Giant Robot anime series and the full cast list is an impressive who's who of giant robot anime from the 70s up till the modern day.<br /><br />All of the standard gameplay mechanics of Super Robot Wars are here as well. All your pilots have their own Spirit Commands akin to magic which they can use to boost themselves or others in nearly any aspect. Pilots also have a Morale rating that rises over the course of battle, boosting their stats, unlocking more powerful attacks, and for some units enabling or automatically triggering super modes or other abilities. Both pilots and the giant robots they fly can be upgraded and developed, improving stats or learning new skills to make them more effective. Like many console releases Tengoku-hen has a dynamic difficulty: there's a bonus objective for every stage (and unlike previous games these can be downright nasty) and depending on how many you earn the game's difficulty changes. Get most of them and you'll play in hard mode, get almost none and you'll play in easy mode, in between lands in Normal mode. And of course there are secret units and characters, not as many as a game like UX but still a handful of people you can recruit or save, and a few snazzy mechs you can get your hands on (Including the only playable version of the Alpha Azieru to date).<br /><br />Tengoku-Hen uses a polished variant of Jigoku-hen's various systems. Like Jigoku you assign 2-unit squads for your characters, with one unit as a main and the other as a supporter that can provide covering fire and more. Also like in Jigoku you can earn Tag Tension stars, and cash them in for an explosive Maximum Break or a special tag command. New to Tengoku is a 5th Tag Command, Boost Dash which gives you a significant movement boost and lets you pass through enemies for one turn. The tactical combo system also returns, your combo rating raises whenever you wipe out an enemy squad, boosting damage and rewards, but drops every time you launch an attack that isn't a cleansweep. Thankfully unlike Jigoku your combo rating ONLY declines if you launch an attack, merely moving a unit does not penalize you anymore. Lastly the AG's Z-Chip shop returns with a larger inventory of ultra-powerful optional parts, but instead of buying passive, global boosts from the shop you get them by investing Z-Chips in your Z-Crystal.<br /><br />And of course the graphics. As usual Banpresto does a smashing job in terms of animation. Super Robot Wars still has some of the prettiest spritework I've ever seen, where units and attacks have an excellent level of design and detail. The previous 3 Z series protagonists, Rand, Setsuko, and Crowe all return with extremely pretty upgraded units. The animation is excellent across the board, and special work is once again done to capture the style of the myriad series that are included in the game.<br /><br />So what's less exciting? Well the balance overall is pretty good, but you get SO MANY units you often you can't even deploy half your roster in any given stage. This means that even a lot of mid-tier units like the Diebuster era Buster Machines or a good number of Mobile Suits simply get edged out by really excellent units like the new Sphere Reactor units or old favorites like Chirico's Scopedog or the Shin Getter Robo. It also doesn't bode very well for units that require investment like Daiguard, and even the newly debuting Chamber can get left in the dust by the stampede of great robots. This massive roster also leads to some frustrating decisions on unit availability. Relegating some characters to only being summon attacks in Z2 were a bit divisive but at least they were things like Sochie and her Capool or the other Silhouette engines in Sara's squad, but in Z3 some fairly major units like the Legend and Infinity Justice Gundams are relegated only to being summoned by attacks. Even more frustrating was the decision to put Toby and Denzel, Xine, and Marguerite from the previous Z games as an attack on a battleship, If they aren't going to be available as fully playable units at the very least they probably should have appeared with Setsuko, Rand, and Crowe respectively.<br /><br />Going along with the roster issue the choices for which series to use and bring back also feel a little off. Turn A Gundam and Gundam X return, but King Gainer is gone despite characters of those three series hanging out quite often in Z1 and 2. Similarly Gravion remains gone despite the Gravion plotline not having actually finished back in Z2 (Poor Eiji, he never did find out about his sister). Zambot 3 and Daitarn 3 return, but Daitarn 3 has little to do but be in a combination attack and the return of Gaizock from Zambot 3 feels weird and superfluous, Gaizock had a perfectly fine death so his return and attempted reintegration into the plot feels forced. The return of the original Aquarion to appear alongside Aquarion EVOL also feels a little unnecessary, and then weird when the game reveals that the first Aquarion has retconned out of Z2 (and the bonus stage of Z1) for some reason. Possibly most galling is the lack of any Eureka 7 series, after being so important in Z1 and Z2 not having either the original or AO for any of the Z3 games feels strange. Lastly despite a lot of build up for it there is no original Shin Mazinkaiser. If ever there was a game that deserved to be graced with Banpresto's most famous creation it was this one.<br /><br />At the end of the day however all these complaints feel sort of like nitpicking. The game is good, great even. Z3.2 is a worthy finale on par if not better than its predecessors like F Final and Alpha 3. The gameplay flows well, the mechanics remain good, the roster is huge and varied, the cast is used well, and after five massive wars Tengoku-hen offers a satisfying conclusion to the ongoing saga.<br /><br />See you next time Banpresto.",2015-08-28

I personally love the click up to store and click down to charge, I'm the type of person who can't leave a phone plugged in at 100% or even leave the charger in the wall be itself. I don't think I'm OCD... It just erks me... The LEDs look pretty cool too so no hate on them. They aren't as bright as I thought they might be which is good.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, it does seem a bit cheap. I don't know how long the click will stay strong or the batteries will last. At least as being new I know the batteries last longer than a 6 hour gaming session. That's about my max on a weekend and I have had no issues with the batteries needing charged mid play. Only time will tell as to there life span, but everything dies eventually. For &#60;$25 I'm ok with that. (I got a charge cable just in case it was ever necessary for &#60;$8. Doubt I'll ever need it...)<br /><br />Lastly I would like to inquire about this struggle to place the controller on charge...? The stand has a little nub that fits perfectly into the Mic usb port on the controller... you just sit your controller on that nub and lean it back, then, click down to charge... I've have to have tried this 100 times already just to see what these reviewer were talking about... I just don't see it... It works flawlessly every time!",2015-08-28

I also haven't followed wrestling for awhile. My son watches a few of the programs each week, but most of what I saw wasn't very interesting. I grew up with the 80s Saturday night wrestling shows with Gordon Solie as announcer, Sunday was WWF/E and even rented the VHS of Wrestlemania I just a few months after it originally happened. I really loved wrestling. Our son is back and forth with it. So there's really not been a reason to buy the games. I hadn't realized 2K had taken over the WWE series until a few weeks ago. That, if nothing else, made me interested in the game since I believe 2K still has developed the best NFL game ever ... in NFL 2K5. And I've enjoyed several of the more current NBA 2K games.<br /><br />The roster had very little impact on my choice of which WWE game to get. Despite being a fan during the 80s and through the Attitude Era, I'm not really into using the wrestlers from those eras, especially those who've passed away. I was more interested in having a fun game. Everything I read on wrestling games forums said 2K14 is better than 2K15, so I ordered a used version, not knowing I would need to buy an online pass since the one included was used by the previous owner.<br /><br />So, I ended up paying ten more dollars for an online pass. Then ended up buying the Season Pass which was another twenty dollars. I really didn't mind the price since I figured it would be enough to last my wrestling game interest for a few years. The game is good, but it's really not that different than I remember the THQ WWE games being. It's a reversal-fest. I ended up lowering the reversal slider all the way down to just one level of it. It was pretty annoying to hit a finisher, pick the guy up and have him reverse your next move. There's plenty of match types to play. And though the roster didn't matter much to me in the beginning, it started to matter once I played the game. I ended up going to the community creations and downloading roughly 90 created wrestlers since there's a lot of active wrestlers not in this game. I would think most notably for current WWE fans, The Wyatt Family. There's some really great created wrestlers in the community creations.<br /><br />We played it off and on for a week or so, but the roster, even with added created wrestlers, just isn't very good. The best created wrestlers don't look much better than the worst default characters. I would rate this higher, but I turned around and bought a new copy of WWE 2K15 for the 360 and liked it quite a bit better. I wouldn't rate either one a five star. There's problems in these games that were around back in 2010. From collision detection, floating wrestlers, a very ambitious &#34;create a finisher&#34; that ends up making you think they really don't put much time into it. Create a Story isn't any better than I remember it being. It more or less reminds me of most sports video games. They update the roster, throw a few new animations in and say it's a new game. I'm also going to review 2K15 as well. A quick ending piece of advice. Only buy used if you're willing to pay the money for the online access which you have to have to download created wrestlers. You also have to have Xbox Gold. I tried a free trial week to the online access only to find out it wouldn't let me download any created wrestlers during the trial. If you buy a new copy it will come with the online access code. One last warning on this one. The server has been having problems for the last 2 weeks. I spent a week trying to download a Great Muta created wrestler only to receive this message, &#34;The WWE 2K14 service is not available. Try again later.&#34; From what I've read they'll most likely shut the server down in the next few months anyway.reations and downloading roughly 90 created wrestlers since there's a lot of active wrestlers not in this game.

My previous setup was as follows: - Astro 5.8 Mixamp (First gen) - Sennheiser PC360's  I purchased this MixAmp because my Astro 5.8 receiver's battery has degraded to the point where it is necessary to supply the receiver unit with USB power or else it would turn off instantly.  I could have just purchased a replacement battery; however, the wireless nature of the 5.8 MixAmp was not really necessary for my setup.  Moreover, from reading around, the MixAmp Pro allowed me to: - Play a game on Xbox, and also be able to pipe in music from my computer on top of the game sound/voice - I'm all about playing COD or Halo to some drum n' bass or breaks.  Unfortunately, when I received the MixAmp Pro, I was unable to resolve the &#34;robotic/muffled voice&#34; issue that so many people are pissed off about here.  So the MixAmp Pro sat in a box and over the past year, and for about 10 months, I slowly attempted to resolve the issue.  I tried everything from replacing the supplied USB cord (multiple times), replacing my 3.5mm/2.5mm cables, powering from a wall USB charger, running game audio through a Wyred4Sound DAC into a Schitt Magni amp, etc.  I tried every conceivable wire configuration and was unable to solve the muffled/robotic voice issue.  The last possible thing was replacing my headset - which I wasn't too keen on.  I read in a drop discussion on MassDrop that the Sennheiser GAME ONE's (and GAME ZERO's (if you'd prefer a closed headset)) had been quietly refreshed by Sennheiser to include a removable audio cable.  My PC 360's had seen better days and had served me well for the years I've had them, and so I decided that I would go ahead and upgrade based on the Game One's being available on MassDrop for a discounted price as well as MassDrop confirming that the version they were selling was the latest revision (i.e. it had the removable cable).  The headphones arrived today and included the standard Y connector that my PC360's had (to split audio and mic).  The GameOnes also included a cable that lacked the Y-splitter/connector and went straight to a standard 3.5mm jack.  Using standard 3.5mm jack, I plugged everything in as follows:  - Optical from Xbox One to MixAmp Pro optical input. - USB from Xbox One to MixAmp Pro (for power) - Turtle Beach &#34;talkback&#34; cable from first-gen Xbox One Controller with Headset Adapter output into MixAmp (note that there is a newer version of the Xbox One Controller - I do not have one so YMMV if you do).  Talkback cable is available here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KC9J1Z4?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00 - Sennheiser GameOne cable straight into MixAmp - using the &#34;Headphone to 3.5mm&#34; cable, not the split cable with a Y adapter I had been using previously with my PC360's.  And everything works as it should - robot voice issue has been eliminated.  The MixAmp does what I was hoping for (computer/ipod audio on top of  console game and voice audio) and I can finally retire my 5.8 MixAmp.  So the issue was really my previous headphones (PC360's) terminating in a Y-split and then using an adapter to bring those back together before plugging into the MixAmp Pro - for some reason the MixAmp Pro didn't like that adapter (or any of the multiple variations of the adapter that I tried).  Astro should be performing better troubleshooting for their customers, or at the very least, test for potential issues with a variety of interconnects and then resolve those issues before selling a product for $200+.  Customers shouldn't have to buy a specific headset  - with a cable that terminates in a specific way - in order to be able to use the MixAmp Pro in the way it is marketed and intended to be used.  Astro annoyed the heck out of me with this, and I wasted quite a bit of money to do the testing that they should have done before the product was released; so I'm giving 3/5 stars.  Hopefully this helps someone out.",2015-08-28

My favorite aspect of this game is the sound and cinematography. When you're walking down a snowy path, hearing footsteps in the snow, wind, trees, animals, and the camera changes to a view where someone on the hillside is watching your movements, and reacting by hiding, and heavily breathing, it really is an 80's horror film. Plenty of homage is paid to some classics as well. It's a &#34;choose your own adventure&#34; cinematic masterpiece. Some people may be upset that it isn't a &#34;game&#34; per se, but there's plenty of mechanics and exploration that are not QTE related. Really the fun lies in deciding who you want your characters to be, and playing them out as such.<br /><br />As I mentioned the sound earlier, that's where the real jump scares come from, and there's plenty. I really enjoyed the twists and scares, and if you have an open mind, you will too.<br /><br />I give it a 9 instead of a 10 because the movement can be slow sometimes (but not like Rapture), and you couldn't always make decisions that you feel your character would.

I first bought the EX-05 and it lasted me about two-three years and it was damn good. After long enough it crapped out and stopped working, but my warranty had been up for whatever reason and they refused to do anything so I shopped around for a new Gioteck product and found the EX-05s. It's been a couple of months since purchase and its microphone has failed. I woke up one morning and the microphone wouldn't pick up any sounds other than tapping on the little control box.<br /><br />Now, here's a breakdown of my rating:<br />Comfort: 3/5<br />Metal bars are uncomfortable and made me wear the headset all wonky sometimes, I preferred the EX-05. However, the ear cups are superb. They fit nice and snug around my ears but not to the point where they're trapped in there.<br />Sound Quality: 5/5<br />I've never owned a super high quality headset with major acclaim, so thus far these headsets are the best I've ever had.<br />Durability: 4/5<br />The EX-05 pooped out after a reasonable time for the price I paid, but the S fell from my graces earlier than I was hoping/expected.<br />Microphone Quality: 5/5<br />Never had complaints from my friends and I felt it was a quite good quality.<br />Support: 1/5<br />Their support is mediocre;<br />&#34;Oh did you open it? It looks like you may have tried to open it, your warranty is void.&#34;<br />&#34;Oh you bought it a more than a year ago? Nope.&#34;<br />Real friendly, huh?<br /><br />Truthfully, I'll never buy a product from Gioteck again and I'm waiting for their support to get back to me. However, these headsets are pretty alright in my opinion, but don't go in expecting them to be these fantastic crafts of grandeur.",2015-08-27

US,24740557,R3UW9JDAEL110F,B00HQPUWBO,530984598,Evolve,Video Games,4,3,4,N,Y,Gotten Better Since Release,"The game has received mixed reviews from all sources, so I'll give it my quick, honest coverage.<br /><br />It looks pretty, sounds amazing, and is a lot of fun to play - to a point. If you get bored of repetition, this is not a game for you. There is one primary game mode that can be played as a competitive online leaderboard chase, Hunt. In addition, the Evacuation &#34;campaign,&#34; and I use that term loosely, adds Nest, Rescue, and Defend modes to Hunt in a 5-stage match with balance shifts to favor the losing side.<br /><br />Alongside these basic modes is Arena, where a Stage 2 Monster is pitted against a Hunter team in a permanent dome: kill or die.<br /><br />Arena is fantastic for quick, entertaining, heart-pounding matches if you like excitement. Evacuation gives you a more immersive experience if you're into feeling the atmosphere of a game, and it's great for leveling up to get your max level perks. Hunt is the game's primary existence, always chasing a few more wins to get the next rank on the boards.<br /><br />Now that the game has expanded to this degree, I feel comfortable rating it 4 stars. Monster gameplay continues to to be unique and thrilling, with Stage 1 being terrifying as you flee the enemy Hunters, and Stage 3 giving one a kind of maniacal ego boost as you rampage all over the poor humans who were silly enough to chase you down. Hunter gameplay is heavily, HEAVILY dependent on good teammates. If you're still learning the game, play in Solo with the difficulty favoring your team or you'll have a hard time winning as Hunter. The best way to play Hunter, though, is to get 3 other friends together and queue up as a full team to destroy the solo Monsters.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is the DLC - the vanity items are wonderful but a bit pricy, and offering new Hunters and Monsters is becoming ridiculous in terms of scheduling. A year to stretch out 5 new characters is excessive, considering the Tier 4 Hunters and Behemoth were all released at the same time. It would also be nice to see price reductions for the older tiers of characters over time, to encourage purchases later on as new content is released.

The question was:  would it live up to the hype.  The answer is far and away YES.  Most likely the greatest football game ever made.  If you like football and know real life football strategy, this is the game for you.<br /><br />WR/DB interactions were one of the big selling points this year and it delivered.  Seeing the animations play out between a WR and DB is a thing of beauty.  Once you learn the controls you realize that player ratings certainly okay a huge factor in how the animations play out.  If your opponent has a big time receiver you had better use bracket coverage or else you will get smoked.  While you would think this would favor the offense, using solid defensive techniques leads to locking down the receivers far more often then not.<br /><br />The running game is also much improved and is easily the best running game released in a video game.  Following your blocks and cutting at the right time is crucial.<br /><br />In CFM, the new in game dynamic goals are very well done and follow along with what's happening in the game.<br /><br />While there are a few bugs to be ironed out, this game is very good.

I bought it new after playing DS2 on the X360; therefore, the game is not as exciting as it first was. I wanted the DLC and to see how it would look on the PS4.<br /><br />Anyway, Scholar's biggest improvements are its fast load times (less than six seconds), smooth frame rate, and ability of the PS4 to handle every lighting and texture effect easily. The game is more stable than the original DS2. No texture pop-ins or muddy lighting or network issues. When you click on bloodstains, the phantom players springs up instantly. For those seeking extra challenge Scholar populates areas with more enemies. Heide knights aplenty await you at Heide's Tower of Flame. Graphically the game looks like a high end PS3/360 game, so if you're hoping this version will be a big visual overhaul, you'll be disappointed. (Bloodborne shows you what a real PS4 title looks like.)<br />I recommend buying Scholar at $29.99, not at its present $39.99 price.

Dying Light is a must-have for zombie enthusiasts.,"Do you like zombies? If yes, you'll love this game. If not, you'll love this game.<br /><br />Dying Light is an amazing first-person zombie apocalypse-themed game set in an open world. Yes, zombies. Yes, open world. You will traverse an expansive urban environment overrun by a vicious epidemic, scavenge the world for supplies and craft weapons to defend against the growing infected population with a heavy focus on parkour mechanics, allowing you to perform actions such as climbing ledges, leaping off from edges, sliding, jumping from roofs to roofs and zip-lining.<br /><br />When I heard about the game, I watched the trailer and saw that it was built around the idea of parkour. My main reservation was wondering how they would incorporate zombies and parkour into a successful game. Unfortunately, I held off on buying the game for quite some time before actually giving it a shot. That was a mistake. The game is mostly melee-based with the majority of fighting using melee weapons. There are more than 100 weapons that can be used and more than 1000 weapon possibilities when players begin crafting new weapons. The melee-weapons have a limited lifespan and will be degraded and eventually broken if you use it for combat for a long time. Yes you can repair the weapon, but only for a limited number of times. Crafting weapons require crafting ingredients such as gauze and metal parts and a blueprint, which can be scavenged or purchased from a shop. I can't even continue to describe how amazing the developers did at incorporating a true survival world and immerse you in it.<br /><br />Most impressive is how much the day-night cycle changes the game drastically, as enemies become more aggressive and more difficult to deal with during night time. I've literally sped the game up to daytime just to avoid how scary playing at night is. I don't think there is a person that owns this game that hasn't, at one point or another, gotten completely spooked at night-time. While you do have a choice in changing between day and night, there are a lot of quests that force you to play at night.<br /><br />If you like zombies, buy this game. If you like open world, buy this game. If you like survival, buy this game. You will not be disappointed!a choice in changing between day and night, there are a lot of quests that force you to play at night.<br /><br />If you like zombies, buy this game.

It is similar to checkers and revolves around beating the computer player or a friend in 2 player.<br /><br />The game does not have any fun animated cut scenes or story to speak of.  Spot does not do any neat dance moves or anything really relevant.  I believe they also made a side scrolling action game for the Gameboy and that was the game I originally wanted to buy and just picked the wrong game.<br /><br />This game pretty much sucks.  You basically win by chance.  It is a turned base puzzle game with very little imagination just move your dots to consume the other player.  Simple games are not bad if they have good play control or a fun little story.  This game was probably just pumped out there for marketing purposes I highly doubt that it helped 7Up sales. If anything it probably drove people away from the brand.<br /><br />1 to 2 star game skip this one and save your money for a better puzzle game like Tetris or Dr. Mario.<br /><br />Gameplay: 3/10<br />Play Control: 4/10<br />Story/Originality: 1/10<br />Challenge: 7/10<br />Replay Value: 2/10,2015-08-27

While its so chock full of horror cliches you'd think it was a parody, they're handled so well and delivered creepily enough to make it worthwhile.<br /><br />The division of plot lines is really well handled, and while a decision at the very beginning doesn't have ripples all the way up to closing credits, it does have ripples past the canned scene. And while the overall feel is as an interactive movie, thats not a bad thing in this case, as the characters are actually characters. While they are all sex-fueled teenagers, past that point they do develop and have impressions beyond Blonde Murder Victim #4 and Brunette Murder Victim #2.<br /><br />Gameplay does have some down moments. Certain qte's don't have any warning, and the still sensor (where you don't move) is so sensitive that putting on a flat surface is too much. Certain moments shouldn't be qte's, but overall, the system works well.

Like the other reviewers have mentioned it is difficult game.  But every Battletoads game is hard.  The game has lots of different types of stages from straight forward beat em ups at the beginning, Rocket scooter, space shooting, jumping platforms, vertical climbing stage all trademarked in the original NES Battletoads game.<br /><br />The sound is very good as well as the graphics for the time period it came out in.  The only downside to the game is that you are only able to be 1 of the 3 toads. The queen taunts you the whole game and you never get to fight her. The final boss is her big huge mechanical henchman guy.  The game is only about 6 or 7 stages long and does not offer a password feature so you have to beat it in one shot.  The play control is spot on and very responsive.<br /><br />The hardest part of the game is getting through the final stage before time runs out.  The stage is pretty unclear what they want you to do once you get to the end.  The final boss was a decent challenge but making it to him was much harder.<br /><br />The trick to beating the game is making it through the lower levels with as many lives as possible.  So on the scooter stage if you keep dying over and over just reset the game and start over until you pass the stage in 3 or 4 tries instead of 10 or more, because you will never have enough lives left to finish the game.<br /><br />Once you beat the game you will have a wonderful feeling of accomplishment like beating Ninja Gaiden for the NES.  These games are difficult even for seasoned players and you should be proud if you complete it.  If the game just had a little more to it, and allowed you to battle the queen and shut her up it would be worth 5 stars but as it is.  It is just a solid 4 star game all around.<br /><br />Gameplay: 8/10<br />Play Control: 9/10<br />Story: 6/10<br />Challenge: 10/10<br />Replay Value: 7/10",2015-08-27

Online gaming is incredibly fun and quite a good way to pass time.<br /><br />That aside, there are downsides to X-Box Live that can be avoided through prepaid cards. Number one, you always run the risk that unwarranted transactions will be made if your credit card information is stored on your X-Box 360 system. It may not happen all that often, but it's best to avoid it all together.<br /><br />The biggest reason to buy prepaid Xbox Live card is the renewal process that happens when you don't use one. If you order X-Box Live through your system, it'll renew every time your subscription runs out. This wouldn't be a problem except that it's not that easy to cancel. Instead of canceling through your system, you have to go through the hassle of actually calling X-Box Live support. Even then, depending on the representative you get, you may be hassled to keep your subscription because they really don't want you to cancel it. I'... Read more",2015-08-27

My opinion and game of the year 2015. The first hour starts off slow and the graphics look weird at first - I think this prologue part of the game may have been added in in a rush and they didn't optimize it correctly? After the prologue, you'll see the graphics are literally photo realistic and the sound is also amazing. The story is top notch and took me about 10 hours to complete.  I cannot believe how convincing the characters are. Again, do not judge the game based on the first hour or two. Once the action starts the game is a ten out of ten. Do not spoil the game by reading tons of info or watching streams! I bought a PS4 for this game and do not regret it one bit. Like I said, starts off slow but once the action starts you won't want to stop playing. Lots of replay value because all your characters can live or die depending in your choices. absolutely worth $60. I loved Heavy Rain on PS3 which played similar to this but honestly, Until Dawn completely destroys Heavy Rain on every level.<br /><br />Must. Own. Game. This is the killer (pun intended) PS4 exclusive we've all been waiting for and certainly my game of the year and generation thus far.",2015-08-27

This would be close to a perfect controller if the designers had actually decided to design around a d-pad, instead of slapping it in a well too tall for it.

Considering that I've played, or at least attempted to play a few 2-d sidescrollers and fighting games on it, it just wasn't adequate.<br /><br />It misses directions. It constantly falls between cardinal directions and diagonals with little rhyme or reason.  And it feels mushy and nasty to use for any length of time.  It's like every d-pad come with soda prespilled inside of it.<br /><br />Which is a shame because the rest of the controller is really nice.  Solidly built, with the right amount of heft.  Feels great to hold, and all of your button and stick placement is where it should be.<br /><br />For your games that don't use a d-pad, its one of the best.

As of now (Aug 2015) it works with all the locomotives I own in game (which is around 75% probably). There was recently a patch that fixed the issues it used to have with many of them.<br /><br />I do love it and am very glad I finally bought it, but there are a couple of negatives that prevent me from giving a full 5 stars.<br /><br />The first is that the reverser has &#34;steps&#34; in it (as does the throttle but it's not much of an issue). There are many of them to be sure, but the first one is around 9%. This makes running steamers a little awkward if you're cruising down level track and want to run at 3% reverser. It's pretty minor and I only mention it for the most picky. When I bought it, I fully expected the reverser to be just forward/N/backward, so it's really not bad.<br /><br />The 2nd issue is again fairly minor, but annoying. The decals/stickers are very poor quality. They look very good, and feel thick/heavy/good quality. However, with very little finger touching the paint/ink/whatever it is comes off fairly rapidly. I emailed them and this is a known issue. So why have they not fixed it? *shrug*  But they'll sell you a new decal sheet for 6 bucks. (Don't forget the 12 or 13 dollars shipping!!!) They'll give you the layout so you can print them yourself though. That's probably what I'll end up doing.<br /><br />The rest works awesomely and I can't imagine having to go back to driving my trains with a keyboard and mouse. I do highly recommend it!!",2015-08-27

US,17058574,R2EP5HNOJFHTEW,B00YXOYHVM,900251835,Xbox One 1TB Console - Halo: The Master Chief Collection Bundle,Video Games,4,4,4,N,N,Buying guide for Xbox One bundles,"I wanted to create a guide to help those interested in purchasing an Xbox One, since there are so many bundles, and offers change constantly. I'll attempt to keep this up to date as the bundles change. This is NOT a comparison to Playstation 4 or Wii U.  A short list of features that may interest you, current and upcoming (November 12, 2015), shared by all Xbox Ones (more details can be found in product descriptions and Microsoft sites) -  HDMI pass through. You can hook up an HDMI device to the back of an Xbox One to view the content from that device without changing inputs or leaving the X1 interface. This allows for split screen viewing and if a cable box or the official TV tuner, you can view the channel guide, watch TV, and set recordings.  It is backwards compatible with some Xbox 360 games. This is great for those with backlogs (like me...) or those who want to revisit finished games without having another console plugged into the wall/TV. In the fall, owners of publisher approved disc or digital 360 games will be able to play them emulated on the X1. Some X1 games also include their 360 precursors with purchase for play on the X1 in case you missed them. Gears or War Ultimate Edition includes all 4 Xbox 360 Gears games and Fallout 4 includes Fallout 3, for example. List of games and other info here -[...]  It will stream content to Windows 10 devices.  Xbox Live Gold now applies to households instead of individuals; meaning that multiple accounts on the same console can have access to the same features but have differing account restrictions (I.E. parental controls). So you can let your kids play Garden Warfare online, but not Gears of War.  External USB 3.0 storage. This is great because, 1) you don't need to open the console and replace a hard disc to add storage, just plug in and the X1 will format the drive, 2) even disc-based games have compulsory installs and can be upwards of 50GB each, eating storage space quickly, 3) external drives can be spaciousand cheap, and last but not least, 4) USB 3.0 is actually faster than the internal hard disc interface. This means that a game on an external drive will load faster than one on the internal drive, usually by a significant amount.  The bundles-  The bundles can be split into 3 different groups based on time of release. The upcoming and current bundles include a newer controller that has a standard 3.5mm audio jack built in and output both game and chat audio through it (excepting the new Kinect bundles). Legacy consoles include an older controller without the standard audio jack and shouldn’t be expected to be widely available at the suggested price (and some I haven’t included, due to their rarity at this point). There are no other functional differences. All bundles include a controller, HDMI cable, chat headset (with exceptions), and a 14 day Xbox Live Gold trial membership (paid $60/year service to play online and download the Games with Gold, a monthly rotation of full games you're free to download and keep (forever for 360 games and as long as you have Live Gold in active subscription for X1 games).  Upcoming bundles (with rating based on what you get for the money. Star and letter ratings are intended for the suggested price listed next to the bundle, not whatever current prices are.) -  Xbox One Elite 1TB bundle. $499. Includes a console with a 1TB hybrid SSD and hard disc for quicker load times for the items you access the most and the Elite controller, which has replaceable/customizable sticks, buttons, and triggers for the professionals or tinkerers. While the internal storage on this will be better than the standard HDDs in other X1s, the performance increase PROBABLY won't match external USB3.0 drives, due to the continued use of the SATA interface. There's little information about the size of the SSD partition and many hybrid drives don't allow you to choose what content is on which partition. The elite controller isn't yet available, but will retail for $150 (about triple the price of a regular controller). If you want the best/most storage and best controller out of the box, this is the bundle for you, but you won't get any games with it, or a headset, from the looks of it. B rating. Also note that this version releases earlier if purchased from the Microsoft Store or Gamestop.  Current bundles -  Fallout 4 1TB bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, Fallout 4 game confirmed to be a disc (!), a download of the Xbox 360 version of Fallout 3, and a chat headset. B+ rating. Two open-world RPGs for grownups.  Rise of the Tomb Raider 1TB bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, downloads of Rise of the Tomb Raider, DLC, and its predecessor, Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition, and doesn't appear to include a headset. Releases November 3rd. B+ rating. The Tomb Raider reboot from 2013 was pretty good and I expect the sequel will be even better. Great for adults who love action adventure. Amazon won't be stocking this one, unfortunately...  Kinect 500GB Bundle - $399. Includes 500GB console, the Kinect camera, a chat headset, the old model controller, and three Kinect-focused game downloads: Dance Central Spotlight, Kinect Sports Rivals and Zoo Tycoon. Finally another Kinect bundle! The X1 UI is made better and more easily navigable with the Kinect, and there are fun, energetic games to be played with it. A rating. Great for those who want to move and enjoy motion and voice controls, but it has little storage.  Holiday 1TB Bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, Gears of War Ultimate Edition disc (as well as all 360 Gears games as downloads if you play online before the end of the year), Rare Replay disc, and Ori and the Blind Forest game download, the new controller, and doesn't appear to include a headset. Releases October 27th. A rating. Something(s) for everyone in this bundle, with 36 games included.  Halo 5 Limited Edition 1TB bundle. $499. Includes custom console with Halo sounds, and custom controller, with the Halo 5 Limited Edition (steelcase, guardian figure, game download and add-on content). Why a limited edition would come without a physical game is beyond me... It may not bother some, but it will upset many. This is a higher premium than the Forza 6 bundle (charging an extra $100 for an extra $40 package). For Halo aficionados/console collectors only.  Lego Movie 500GB bundle - $349. Includes 500GB console and the Lego Movie Videogame and no headset, apparently. C+ rating. Game is a cheap one and good for kids, but little value in this bundle compared to others.  FIFA and Madden 16 1TB bundles. $399. I'm grouping these together because other than the type of football you prefer, they are the same. Both include either the latest Madden NFL or FIFA soccer game download and a year of EA access, a paid ($30/yr) service which allows Xbox One users early access to EA releases, extended demos with progress that can be saved if a full game is purchased, discounts on EA games, and free access to the Vault, currently 14 full games. Great if you like EA's games. A- for each.  Gears of War 500GB bundle. $349. Includes Gears of War Ultimate Edition download (as well as all 360 Gears games if you play online before the end of the year). This 500GB model includes the new controller, but does not include a headset. B+ rating.  Legacy bundles-  Forza 6 1TB Bundle. $399. Custom Forza-inspired console with racing sounds and custom controller, and download code for Forza 6 and extra content, and a chat headset. A- rating, though some may not like the custom design and sounds.  Halo Master Chief Collection 1TB bundle. $399. Looks like this being phased out. Standard console, plus download code for the Master Chief Collection (the four numbered Halo games in a single package). B rating.  Halo Master Chief 500GB bundle. $349. If you can get it at the retail price, I'd consider it an A-, since the cost to upgrade storage to 1TB or greater is around or less than the $50 to get the 1TB model, and it'll perform better.  Keep in mind that the lowest prices and best bundles tend to happen around the winter holiday season, so unless you really want to get one now, you're probably best served waiting till around Black Friday, when multiple stores will be trying to entice you with lower prices and more pack-ins. This is especially true since Sony recently cut the price of the Playstation 4.",2015-08-27

Received a few replacements after the original review.  Review has been updated.,"I've had this product for about 3 weeks now, and I just had to put a warranty claim on the product; because it was defective the day I got it.  I tried troubleshooting it and seeing if certain accessories were creating too much drain on the batteries.  After testing, I'm sure the batteries are okay, but the charging station itself is defective.  The charging stand was giving the \\""green light\\"" for being full charged, when it was only, at best, slightly over half charged.  Product details state you should be getting about 40 playable hours with two fully charged battery packs (which are provided in the purchase).  After the initial charging, I may have gotten 10 hours of play time between both batteries combined.  I did have a Turtle Beach Headset plugged into the controller; but without it, I may only get between 12-14 hours between two fully charged batteries.  I bought this product because I was sick and tired of the plug-and-play chargers constantly breaking within 6 months to a year from purchase, and my battery pack (which I had for a year), was down to 10-12 hours per full charge,  So, even after a year of use and using a Turtle Beach Headset, the old battery was lasting almost twice as long.  I don't think the problem is with the batteries that are included with this product, it's something with the charger indicating that the batteries are fully charged and discontinuing the charging after the light turns green.  That part of the product is defective.  This wouldn't be a problem, if I could just hook the controller up to a USB (like you can with most of rechargeable battery packs for XBox One) to charge.  I've tried it, and all it does is plug the controller to the system, and doesn't charge it at all.  You have to use the quick charge station in this package, because the way the battery is designed and how it changes the charging port from the top plug-in potion of the controller to the bottom of the battery cover.  Right now I have a ticket in on the Performance Designed Products webpage, [...], which is where you have to put all your warranty claims and report or get help with any problems you are having with your product.  It was inconveniently marked in the fine print on the bottom of the box.  Also, for those who think they might need an instruction manual for how to operate it, there is none.  It just eludes to, on the box, that \\""Red\\"" light means charging, and \\""Green\\"" light means fully charged.  It's simple to figure out, but I know some people are going to want instructions of some sort.    Update: I've had 4 replacement batteries sent, and a new charger.  I'm still getting only about 5-7 hours from any of the batteries after full charging them on this charger; and the stand is the only way to charge their special batteries.  Also it takes a little over 2 hours to fully charge these batteries off the stand, which makes the fact I'm only getting 5-7 hours of play time is pretty unsatisfactory. It still only shows as slightly more than half charged when you check the batteries status, after \\""fully\\"" charging them, on the XBox dashboard.  So it's either false advertisement that we're supposed to get about 40 hrs of play time between the 2 battery packs included, or they're not inspecting the merchandise when they leave the factory.  I'm just going to get another plug and play with rechargeable battery the next time I need to replace batteries.  The battery on that last about as long, probably longer, then the two battery packs included in this package combined.    Update: They've sent me 4 replacement batteries, and replaced the charging stand.  Still does not work as advertised.  Batteries are still charging halfway to 3/4 (even when it says fully charged) and still only giving 5-7 hours instead of the advertised 20 hours.  Not to mention, only used some of the replacements once, and now 5 of the total 6, that I received from the original purchase and replacements, will not charge at all on the charger stand.  Thisis absurd.  It's beyond incompetence and I can't even imagine it stands to measure up to even the lowest standard of quality.",2015-08-27

US,17058574,RS7XWJS5Z7X3,B00TY9KYKE,380072729,Xbox One 500GB Console -  Halo: The Master Chief Collection Bundle,Video Games,4,14,14,N,N,Buying Guide for Xbox One bundles,"I wanted to create a guide to help those interested in purchasing an Xbox One, since there are so many bundles, and offers change constantly. I'll attempt to keep this up to date as the bundles change. This is NOT a comparison to Playstation 4 or Wii U.  A short list of features that may interest you, current and upcoming (November 12, 2015), shared by all Xbox Ones (more details can be found in product descriptions and Microsoft sites) -  HDMI pass through. You can hook up an HDMI device to the back of an Xbox One to view the content from that device without changing inputs or leaving the X1 interface. This allows for split screen viewing and if a cable box or the official TV tuner, you can view the channel guide, watch TV, and set recordings.  It is backwards compatible with some Xbox 360 games. This is great for those with backlogs (like me...) or those who want to revisit finished games without having another console plugged into the wall/TV. In the fall, owners of publisher approved disc or digital 360 games will be able to play them emulated on the X1. Some X1 games also include their 360 precursors with purchase for play on the X1 in case you missed them. Gears or War Ultimate Edition includes all 4 Xbox 360 Gears games and Fallout 4 includes Fallout 3, for example. List of games and other info here -[...]  It will stream content to Windows 10 devices.  Xbox Live Gold now applies to households instead of individuals; meaning that multiple accounts on the same console can have access to the same features but have differing account restrictions (I.E. parental controls). So you can let your kids play Garden Warfare online, but not Gears of War.  External USB 3.0 storage. This is great because, 1) you don't need to open the console and replace a hard disc to add storage, just plug in and the X1 will format the drive, 2) even disc-based games have compulsory installs and can be upwards of 50GB each, eating storage space quickly, 3) external drives can be spaciousand cheap, and last but not least, 4) USB 3.0 is actually faster than the internal hard disc interface. This means that a game on an external drive will load faster than one on the internal drive, usually by a significant amount.  The bundles-  The bundles can be split into 3 different groups based on time of release. The upcoming and current bundles include a newer controller that has a standard 3.5mm audio jack built in and output both game and chat audio through it (excepting the new Kinect bundles). Legacy consoles include an older controller without the standard audio jack and shouldn’t be expected to be widely available at the suggested price (and some I haven’t included, due to their rarity at this point). There are no other functional differences. All bundles include a controller, HDMI cable, chat headset (with exceptions), and a 14 day Xbox Live Gold trial membership (paid $60/year service to play online and download the Games with Gold, a monthly rotation of full games you're free to download and keep (forever for 360 games and as long as you have Live Gold in active subscription for X1 games).  Upcoming bundles (with rating based on what you get for the money. Star and letter ratings are intended for the suggested price listed next to the bundle, not whatever current prices are.) -  Xbox One Elite 1TB bundle. $499. Includes a console with a 1TB hybrid SSD and hard disc for quicker load times for the items you access the most and the Elite controller, which has replaceable/customizable sticks, buttons, and triggers for the professionals or tinkerers. While the internal storage on this will be better than the standard HDDs in other X1s, the performance increase PROBABLY won't match external USB3.0 drives, due to the continued use of the SATA interface. There's little information about the size of the SSD partition and many hybrid drives don't allow you to choose what content is on which partition. The elite controller isn't yet available, but will retail for $150 (about triple the price of a regular controller). If you want the best/most storage and best controller out of the box, this is the bundle for you, but you won't get any games with it, or a headset, from the looks of it. B rating. Also note that this version releases earlier if purchased from the Microsoft Store or Gamestop.  Current bundles -  Fallout 4 1TB bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, Fallout 4 game confirmed to be a disc (!), a download of the Xbox 360 version of Fallout 3, and a chat headset. B+ rating. Two open-world RPGs for grownups.  Rise of the Tomb Raider 1TB bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, downloads of Rise of the Tomb Raider, DLC, and its predecessor, Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition, and doesn't appear to include a headset. Releases November 3rd. B+ rating. The Tomb Raider reboot from 2013 was pretty good and I expect the sequel will be even better. Great for adults who love action adventure. Amazon won't be stocking this one, unfortunately...  Kinect 500GB Bundle - $399. Includes 500GB console, the Kinect camera, a chat headset, the old model controller, and three Kinect-focused game downloads: Dance Central Spotlight, Kinect Sports Rivals and Zoo Tycoon. Finally another Kinect bundle! The X1 UI is made better and more easily navigable with the Kinect, and there are fun, energetic games to be played with it. A rating. Great for those who want to move and enjoy motion and voice controls, but it has little storage.  Holiday 1TB Bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, Gears of War Ultimate Edition disc (as well as all 360 Gears games as downloads if you play online before the end of the year), Rare Replay disc, and Ori and the Blind Forest game download, the new controller, and doesn't appear to include a headset. Releases October 27th. A rating. Something(s) for everyone in this bundle, with 36 games included.  Halo 5 Limited Edition 1TB bundle. $499. Includes custom console with Halo sounds, and custom controller, with the Halo 5 Limited Edition (steelcase, guardian figure, game download and add-on content). Why a limited edition would come without a physical game is beyond me... It may not bother some, but it will upset many. This is a higher premium than the Forza 6 bundle (charging an extra $100 for an extra $40 package). For Halo aficionados/console collectors only.  Lego Movie 500GB bundle - $349. Includes 500GB console and the Lego Movie Videogame and no headset, apparently. C+ rating. Game is a cheap one and good for kids, but little value in this bundle compared to others.  FIFA and Madden 16 1TB bundles. $399. I'm grouping these together because other than the type of football you prefer, they are the same. Both include either the latest Madden NFL or FIFA soccer game download and a year of EA access, a paid ($30/yr) service which allows Xbox One users early access to EA releases, extended demos with progress that can be saved if a full game is purchased, discounts on EA games, and free access to the Vault, currently 14 full games. Great if you like EA's games. A- for each.  Gears of War 500GB bundle. $349. Includes Gears of War Ultimate Edition download (as well as all 360 Gears games if you play online before the end of the year). This 500GB model includes the new controller, but does not include a headset. B+ rating.  Legacy bundles-  Forza 6 1TB Bundle. $399. Custom Forza-inspired console with racing sounds and custom controller, and download code for Forza 6 and extra content, and a chat headset. A- rating, though some may not like the custom design and sounds.  Halo Master Chief Collection 1TB bundle. $399. Looks like this being phased out. Standard console, plus download code for the Master Chief Collection (the four numbered Halo games in a single package). B rating.  Halo Master Chief 500GB bundle. $349. If you can get it at the retail price, I'd consider it an A-, since the cost to upgrade storage to 1TB or greater is around or less than the $50 to get the 1TB model, and it'll perform better.  Keep in mind that the lowest prices and best bundles tend to happen around the winter holiday season, so unless you really want to get one now, you're probably best served waiting till around Black Friday, when multiple stores will be trying to entice you with lower prices and more pack-ins. This is especially true since Sony recently cut the price of the Playstation 4.  Hope you found this comparison useful.",2015-08-27

I preordered this through Best Buy and received another Playmaker bundle with 5 MUT packs.  This was in addition to the Playmaker pack and 36 you get form Deluxe.  Opened 2 playmakers and 6 MUT packs on opening night and all I got was a handful of 50s, 60's and 2 Antonio Browns which seem to be the only Playmaker you get in these Playmaker packs.  Seriously... opened 2 playmakers and I get two identical 90 Antonio Browns.  The pack rewards are clearly fixed.<br /><br />Gameplay- Slowed down considerably from Madden 15.  All players feel like they are walking their routes instead of running.  I don't have lag, just the tempo is very slow and feels clunky.<br /><br />Defense is non-existent.  Offense can now throw a Hail Mary on 1st and 10 and with the new &#34;Y' button Aggressive catch, the receiver catches it 85% of the time.  Defense is always 2 steps behind the receiver, so every game I've played in, both myself and opponent finish with 95% completion rates.  Keep in mind this is with my Level 72 MUT team.<br /><br />Overall- A complete waste of money.  I spent 69.99 compared to what I could have had with Amazon's pre order of the Standard edition for $45.00 just for a handful of scrubs and a fixed Playmaker Antonio Brown thats in all Playmaker packs.",2015-08-27

Tired of the Electronic Arts Sports Monopolies.,"The problem is Electronic Arts (EA).  Again, it's the same football game.  The player animations are robotic.  There is some sharpness in the expressionless faces, but it really just adds to the lack of player fluidity.  New features are overstated and unimpressive.  Generally, the new pass-catching options are wasted in a seemingly half-hearted effort.  I see no difference from the old passing controls to the &#34;new&#34; controls.  More annoying Phil Simms and Jim Nance and their idiotic commentary.  It's the same dialogue as before.    I am a Franchise mode player.  The scouting is wasted energy.  Drafting is rather boring, redundant and uninformative.  It is like playing the same game as the last 5 years that I played on PS3, only there is more sharp graphics and much worse player animation.  The game tasks you as a coach or owner to do meaningless work.  The game is so gummed up with unnecessary tasks and options that when you aren't in a game (the same old presentation) it is more of a football business simulation, than a VIDEO GAME.  There is no reason that Electronic Arts can't insert some FUN aspects into a game.  Maybe some real theatre, fun development choices and cut scenes.  Some DEPTH!  We love football but we play the football video game for fun.  Electronic Arts can make it fun but they don't.  Electronic Arts are successful capitalists, but not successful game-makers.  They make money because they know how to market games, and because gamers have no other option when it comes to entire genres.  I suppose if you've never played a football video game then Madden 16 is going to be pretty good.  But if you want to play a complete football game then you are STUCK with EA Football year after year.  EA games are the only games that have ever froze.  I have grown to steer away from games that have the ugly &#34;EA&#34; on the cover of game boxes.  Of course I will play it.  As a football game fanatic, what other choice is there?  I loathe EA's need to control sports game titles.",2015-08-27

It's a football game, the new game won't feature players throwing around baseballs. It's like saying each Call of Duty game is the same because soldiers run around and shoot the bad guy.<br /><br />First the pros<br />Face mapping is pretty cool, players in game look like players in real life.<br /><br />New passing system seems to be solid. I do like the catch option though I usually forget to hit any of the buttons.<br /><br />The run game seems more realistic as you will need to follow blockers and sometimes your lineman just gets flat out beat.<br /><br />Defensively I do like that you can fight for the ball better as a db but it doesn't seem like anything else has changed there.<br /><br />There are more motion changes as players jump and fight for the ball, and the ball can be tipped into the air to get picked off.<br /><br />Cons<br />The play by play needs to be completely revamped. EA needs to get new people, even if they completely rewrite the script, no one wants to hear Phil Simms.<br /><br />If you run the no huddle, there is a good chance the defense will get called for encroachment or offsides. This is a glitch from past years and needs to be fixed.<br /><br />Player dynamics are still weird at times. Legs and arms get bent into Weird positions during tackles and it looks very painful.<br /><br />The in game Sim is not very realistic. I just simmed defense in my last game and my Raiders held the Bears to 5 yards passing and shut them out?<br /><br />Overall I like the game so far, the in game menus are a bit busy for me, the running game is kind of clunky, and not a lot of changes on defense but I have to give it 3 stars. Not too bad.",2015-08-27

It's also nice to be able to hear both the chat volume with your friends and the game volume from your game being played through the same speaker. You can also control the volume of both very easily, which is nice. The actual mic that you talk into is also very sensitive and you don't have to be speaking loudly at all for everyone to hear you clearly. They fit comfortably on your head and they are relatively durable. The only thing I've noticed with them is that there isn't much noise cancellation coming out of the headphones, meaning that everyone and their mother can hear exactly what you're hearing while they're on your head.

Spongebob Heropants is glorified merchandise that's meant to tie in with the recent movie, Sponge Out of Water. If you haven't seen the movie yet, I recommend watching it if you're a Spongebob fan and/or like non-serious, over-the-top adventures. This game, on the other hand, is possibly the dullest Spongebob title ever. It makes you wonder why Activision didn't bother hiring Heavy Iron Studios to make a game similar to Spongebob's glory days in gaming.<br /><br />So let's get on with the plot, shall we? Once upon a time Spongebob and co. go to the Krusty Krab to find chaos, and then Bubbles the Talking Dolphin warps in to tell them there's trouble and they must collect book pages. The End. I'm serious. There's no real villain or anything, and spoiler alert: Spongebob's head contained the necessary missing pages the whole time. There was absolutely no effort put into the writing - The only way you'd know who Bubbles is is if you watched the movie. Here, he comes completely out of nowhere with none of his character explained -  and the cutscenes that aren't the intro and ending feature the characters turned AWAY from the camera view!<br /><br />If you long for the days of Heavy Iron's love and effort into the Spongebob games they've created, prepare for a giant smack in the face as you play through the most basic platforming levels ever that this game consists of THROUGHOUT ITS ENTIRETY. It's actually very comparable to Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric, except that game looked better and made even the SMALLEST kind of effort to change up things. Here? Every level has the same super-repetitive platforming style of play. You run around, you mash the attack button to make the enemies a complete joke, press floor buttons or push blocks when necessary, grab keys to open doors, and then spend a chunk of your time figuring out why you are playing this. Rinse and repeat.<br /><br />Being that this game was surprisingly made in Unity (a program normally used by indie developers), it's also kinda baffling to see that this game makes the same kind of technical flaws and performance that amateur Unity projects have faced. While Spongebob and co. control just fine, there are some glitches in the game that you'd think could easily be fixed by AAA developers, but NOPE! The blocks you push apparently have not been tested too much; if you push it off a platform, it falls down in a much slower framerate than the rest of the game, and if it's on a rising platform, collision between it and the player would result in it SINKING into the platform! DO NOT be surprised when you encounter glitchiness in this game.<br />Then again, if you know well, you know not to buy this crap.<br /><br />There are merely three worlds in total, but each one feels like an absolute drag. When the game finally decides to end a world, it does it pathetically; there are two bosses, and they are just as much of a cakewalk to beat as the average enemy. The Plankton robot in the first world executes easily avoidable attacks slowly, and all you do is hit his eye. The Squidward dinosaur in the second world simply chases after you in a short level. Lastly, the third world contains no boss. It's just Spongebob trying to wake himself up from his &#34;imagination&#34; (or lack of, in this case) via the ending cutscene. There is a &#34;Best Ending&#34; you can obtain by collecting every additional page in the levels, but many actually force you to have a friend or relative to help you collect them. The endings themselves are painfully dumb, regardless, and are definitely not worth the extra effort. Why would I collect all the pages just to watch Bubbles breakdance in front of our tarnished heroes? I shouldn't have to put in any effort if the game isn't going to anytime soon!<br /><br />Barnacles, what kind of Pinhead Larry would think something like this was a good idea? Spongebob Heropants is totally one of the worst Spongebob games I've ever played, period.

US,50120605,R1ZANGD4NOXGIT,B00MV7KVP4,92208606,Until Dawn  - PlayStation 4 [Digital Code],Video Games,5,3,4,N,N,Dear 90's horror flick...I love you!,"An early tragedy in the game causes the death of some characters who we are introduced to at the very beginning of the game.  After 1 year, friends decide to reunite up in a lonely ski lodge cabin, although many have clear reservations about the inappropriateness of the venue and the circumstances that befell them 1 year prior.  And that's about all the story spoiling that you'll get from me and the 8 characters who meet their fate at the hands of your own decision-making.  This game is a definite love letter to the 90's horror flick. It has a definite Scream meets Final Destination vibe to it with Butterfly Effect concepts shamelessly sprinkled into it. What makes it all the more intriguing is the &#34;butterfly effect&#34; story system. Seemingly innocuous choices--including an early choice to see who is calling your friend's cell phone when it's none of your business--affect the story further down the line. As a result, there is HUGE replay potential here. What would have happened if I left the cell phone alone? What happens if I decide to throw a snowball at a bird instead of my friend instead? A flutter of butterflies in the upper left-hand corner of the screen will briefly signal that you've made a choice that affects the story further down the line...you never know if the choice that you're making on the first playthrough is going to matter or not, but as soon as you make it, you'll know that you've chosen a fate, no matter &#34;how the hell does that affect anything&#34; may seem at the time. Add to that unusual 4th wall-breaking sessions with a doctor between &#34;scenes&#34; who asks questions about what makes you uneasy/anxious/scared and you have created an exotic mixture of &#34;what the hell is going to happen to me now?!?&#34; And there are bigger questions - the doctor is talking to you...but who are YOU??  It's somewhat surreal and even has you questioning why he's talking to you and why it even matters.  What's even MORE fun is the discovery of totems that are color-coded based on the type of event that they foretell and offer you a very brief glimpse of the future. All of these diverse elements do a great job in adding dread to the game. That, and there are clues scattered throughout the area that may/may not help you unravel the mystery of what's going on and may/may not help you save more lives literally UNTIL DAWN.  Maybe it matters...maybe it doesn't.  Maybe harming a small animal affects something.  You'll never know...until you try...and see the consequences of your various actions unfold.  Decisions also affect how people interact with you...and whether or not they'll be willing to help you later.  While the system feels obvious on the surface, how it ultimately unfolds is not unlike a Walking Dead experience as executed by TT Games.  It's fantastic fun and I can't wait to try alternative roads in the future.  If you liked Heavy Rain, you'll be in good company here....except that the game mechanics are not nearly as clunky and they feel like they make more sense. QTE moments help to ratchet up the tension and they don't feel cheap...when you're on the run, having good reflexes make sense and they don't cheapen the experience like Resident Evil 6 did, for example. So far, I'm giving it a 4.75/5. It's not perfect, but I'm dying to play it some more already...I've only scratched the surface; that alone warrants a full 5 stars for me. A game like this has been a loooong time in the making and I'm glad that it's here.  One additional note:  the score is exceptional on this film.  The song &#34;O Death&#34; will give you chills as the opening credits roll and sets the tone for the game early.  Voice acting is great and the game is very self-aware of its roots, and rolls around in its genre's playground willingly and with a great amount of fun I might add.  Enjoy the ride...it's going to be a long night.",2015-08-27

It has basically the same style game play. I'm probably about half-way through the game and I still am not sure exactly what is going on. I like that the story changes depending on what decisions you make (the butterfly effect). And also each character you play (you end up at one point or another playing each character the game revolves around, which is 8 characters, 6 of which I've played so far) has stats that change depending on what decisions you make in the game. Bravery, romantic, honest, funny, etc...and also for each character, that character has relationship stats for all the other characters that change. So your relationship with the other characters you interact with changes depending on your decisions, as well as your personality.<br /><br />It's a mystery/horror game. Some of the atmosphere reminds me of The Evil Within and the Saw movies as well as the heavy, disturbing atmosphere of Heavy Rain and Beyond Two Souls.<br /><br />If you don't like the action-button-timing type play, you'll hate the game probably.

My brother and I had Turtle Beach headsets for the Xbox 360.<br /><br />Apparently you can get some sort of converter or something that allows use of an Xbox 360 headset on an Xbox One, but I did not know that until I bough this one.  I probably would have decided to go with this either way because it was designed to be compatible with Xbox One in the first place.  I am assuming there will be better quality  and ease of use than in using the converter option.<br /><br />The headphones are comfortable and offer separate volume controls for the game and chat audio.  The wire connecting to the controller is insulated with braided material rather than something with a plastic or rubber feel.  This does draw power from the controller; but, on the other hand, it also wireless from the TV which is a nice improvement.<br /><br />You can hear your own voice as a part of the game chat audio channel.  This is helpful to prevent you from yelling (which I apparently did on the Xbox 360) and to make you aware of any annoying background noise coming from your own environment (such as breathing into the mic which I also did on the Xbox 360).  I find that really annoying, personally.  If only they had told me sooner I would have done something about it... Anyway, if you do not prefer to hear yourself, I do not think that you can turn this feature off.<br /><br />The buttons used to change the volume are really weird.  On the left, you select game or chat while on the right you increase or decrease the volume. This is difficult to use because there is no indicator as to which one you are about to adjust.  Therefore, it seems it is best to always select game or chat before increasing or decreasing the volume.  I would suggest that they put the game increase and decrease on one side and the chat increase and decrease on the other.  That way you would just know which one you were about to adjust every time based on it being on the right or left side.  Simpler is always better.<br /><br />I am happy with these headphones.  My brother bought some Polk headphones (as they enter the gaming headset market from building quality audio equipment).  He said that others struggle to hear him on his mic.  His mic can hide (slide inside the housing and click into place) when not in use.  Obviously that is way more cool than a mini microphone boom complete with its own foam cover like on this Turtle Beach, but it apparently might not work nearly as well.  In their defense, the mic on these Turtle Beach headphones does detach.  This is helpful in storage, but do not lose it!<br /><br />On a side note, I got this on Amazon Prime Day with &#34;discounts better than Black Friday,&#34; and it was an extra $5 off from the day before.  I am not sure that was worth all the hype and advertising.",2015-08-27

US,17058574,R3QEHRKPDDDJ3F,B011L4D30W,539645461,Xbox One 1TB Console - EA Sports Madden NFL 16 Bundle,Video Games,4,79,82,N,N,Buying Guide for Xbox One bundles,"I wanted to create a guide to help those interested in purchasing an Xbox One, since there are so many bundles, and offers change constantly. I'll attempt to keep this up to date as the bundles change. This is NOT a comparison to Playstation 4 or Wii U.  There doesn't seem to be a promotion for these currently (though there should be some for Black Friday). The new designation for Console with one controller and Console with two controllers just lets you toggle between the standard bundle and the bundle with an extra new controller at about full price. You'd actually save a few buck buying separately, so I wouldn't go for any of them (I don't expect any controllers, except the Elite, to be scarce this season).  A short list of features that may interest you, shared by all Xbox Ones (more details can be found in product descriptions and Microsoft sites) -  HDMI pass through. You can hook up an HDMI device to the back of an Xbox One to view the content from that device without changing inputs or leaving the X1 interface. This allows for split screen viewing and if a cable box or the official TV tuner, you can view the channel guide, watch TV, and set recordings.  It is backwards compatible with some Xbox 360 games. This is great for those with backlogs (like me...) or those who want to revisit finished games without having another console plugged into the wall/TV. In the fall, owners of publisher approved disc or digital 360 games will be able to play them emulated on the X1. Some X1 games also include their 360 precursors with purchase for play on the X1 in case you missed them. Gears or War Ultimate Edition includes all 4 Xbox 360 Gears games and Fallout 4 includes Fallout 3, for example. List of games and other info here -[...]  It will stream content to Windows 10 devices.  Xbox Live Gold now applies to households instead of individuals; meaning that multiple accounts on the same console can have access to the same features but have differing account restrictions(I.E. parental controls). So you can let your kids play Garden Warfare online, but not Gears of War.  External USB 3.0 storage. This is great because, 1) you don't need to open the console and replace a hard disc to add storage, just plug in and the X1 will format the drive, 2) even disc-based games have compulsory installs and can be upwards of 50GB each, eating storage space quickly, 3) external drives can be spacious and cheap, and last but not least, 4) USB 3.0 is actually faster than the internal hard disc interface. This means that a game on an external drive will load faster than one on the internal drive, usually by a significant amount.  The bundles-  The bundles can be split into 3 different groups based on time of release. The upcoming and current bundles include a newer controller that has a standard 3.5mm audio jack built in and output both game and chat audio through it (excepting the new Kinect bundles). Legacy consoles include an older controller without the standard audio jack (excepting the Forza 6 bundle) and shouldn’t be expected to be widely available at the suggested price (and some I haven’t included, due to their rarity at this point). There are no other functional differences. All bundles include a controller, HDMI cable, chat headset (with exceptions), and a 14 day Xbox Live Gold trial membership (paid $60/year service to play online and download the Games with Gold, a monthly rotation of full games you're free to download and keep (forever for 360 games and as long as you have Live Gold in active subscription for X1 games).  Upcoming bundles (with rating based on what you get for the money. Star and letter ratings are intended for the suggested price listed next to the bundle, not whatever current prices are.) -  Xbox One Elite 1TB bundle. $499. Includes a console with a 1TB hybrid SSD and hard disc for quicker load times for the items you access the most and the Elite controller, which has replaceable/customizable sticks, buttons, andtriggers for the professionals or tinkerers. While the internal storage on this will be better than the standard HDDs in other X1s, the performance increase PROBABLY won't match external USB3.0 drives, due to the continued use of the SATA interface. There's little information about the size of the SSD partition and many hybrid drives don't allow you to choose what content is on which partition. The elite controller has been released to wide acclaim (modifiable professional controllers can easily go for twice as much), but is scarce at present. If you want the best/most storage and best controller out of the box, this is the bundle for you, but you won't get any games with it, or a headset, from the looks of it. B rating. Also note that this version releases earlier if purchased from the Microsoft Store or Gamestop.  Current bundles -  Fallout 4 1TB bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, Fallout 4 game confirmed to be a disc (!), a download of the Xbox 360 version of Fallout 3, and a chat headset. B+ rating. Two open-world RPGs for grownups.  Rise of the Tomb Raider 1TB bundle - $399. Includes 1TB console, downloads of Rise of the Tomb Raider, DLC, and its predecessor, Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition, and doesn't appear to include a headset. Releases November 3rd. B+ rating. The Tomb Raider reboot from 2013 was pretty good and I expect the sequel will be even better. Great for adults who love action adventure. Amazon won't be stocking this one, unfortunately...  Kinect 500GB Bundle - $399. Includes 500GB console, the Kinect camera, a chat headset, the old model controller, and three Kinect-focused game downloads: Dance Central Spotlight, Kinect Sports Rivals and Zoo Tycoon. Finally another Kinect bundle! The X1 UI is made better and more easily navigable with the Kinect, and there are fun, energetic games to be played with it. A rating. Great for those who want to move and enjoy motion and voice controls, but it has little storage.  Holiday 1TB Bundle - $399. Includes1TB console, Gears of War Ultimate Edition disc (as well as all 360 Gears games as downloads if you play online before the end of the year), Rare Replay disc, and Ori and the Blind Forest game download, the new controller, and doesn't appear to include a headset. Releases October 27th. A rating. Something(s) for everyone in this bundle, with 36 games included.  Halo 5 Limited Edition 1TB bundle. $499. Includes custom console with Halo sounds, and custom controller, with the Halo 5 Limited Edition (steelcase, guardian figure, game download and add-on content). Why a limited edition would come without a physical game is beyond me... It may not bother some, but it will upset many. This is a higher premium than the Forza 6 bundle (charging an extra $100 for an extra $40 package). For Halo aficionados/console collectors only.  Lego Movie 500GB bundle - $349. Includes 500GB console and the Lego Movie Videogame and no headset, apparently. C+ rating. Game is a cheap one and good for kids, but little value in this bundle compared to others.  FIFA and Madden 16 1TB bundles. $399. (I think these are being phased/sold out) I'm grouping these together because other than the type of football you prefer, they are the same. Both include either the latest Madden NFL or FIFA soccer game download and a year of EA access, a paid ($30/yr) service which allows Xbox One users early access to EA releases, extended demos with progress that can be saved if a full game is purchased, discounts on EA games, and free access to the Vault, currently 14 full games. Great if you like EA's games. A- for each. With the live Gold card and Forza Horizon 2 download (separate product pages) A rating.  Gears of War 500GB bundle. $349. Includes Gears of War Ultimate Edition download (as well as all 360 Gears games if you play online before the end of the year). This 500GB model includes the new controller, but does not include a headset. B+ rating. With the live Gold card and Forza Horizon 2 download (separate product pages) A rating.  Legacy bundles-  Forza 6 1TB Bundle. $399. Custom Forza-inspired console with racing sounds and custom (new, with 3.5mm audio jack) controller, and download code for Forza 6 and extra content, and a chat headset. A- rating, though some may not like the custom design and sounds.  Halo Master Chief Collection 1TB bundle. $399. Looks like this being phased out. Standard console, plus download code for the Master Chief Collection (the four numbered Halo games in a single package). B rating.  Halo Master Chief 500GB bundle. $349. If you can get it at the retail price, I'd consider it an A-, since the cost to upgrade storage to 1TB or greater is around or less than the $50 to get the 1TB model, and it'll perform better.  Keep in mind that the lowest prices and best bundles tend to happen around the winter holiday season, so unless you really want to get one now, you're probably best served waiting till around Black Friday, when multiple stores will be trying to entice you with lower prices and more pack-ins. This is especially true since Sony recently cut the price of the Playstation 4.  At this point, I think the best offer for the holidays for an X1 bundle will be for $50 off current price point, plus an extra game and second controller (Dell at least, will offer such a deal). The risk is availability and whether the bundle or extra game would be one you'd want.  Hope this was useful to you.",2015-08-27

Although it's pretty much self explanatory looking at it as to where to USB ports are, charging dock and etc - meaning it's a user friendly product. I like how you can put the ps4 vertically making it space friendly too. The quality is average.  According to my hubby the cooling fan is not doing so well with keeping the ps4 from overheating.

I happened to be out of town for a few weeks when this came out.<br />When I got back from my trip, I wanted to get a copy and get back to golfing with my friends from the old TW13 / 14 Country Club.<br />I was pretty surprised to see so many low priced copies on Amazon.  Less than 2 weeks after release, there were copies for $40 on Amazon.<br /><br />So I grabbed one, wondering why so many were flooding the market with their recent $60 purchases.<br /><br />Well, no alt shot, no country clubs AT ALL, very few courses and the general sterile / bland feel of this game have me understanding why people were dumping this title so fast, and for so little.  It is a surprisingly weak effort after going more than 2 years between releases.<br />There are always promises of more courses around the corner, and they have dished out Scottsdale, but that still keeps the course total in the single digits.  Granted, there are a few pretend courses, but honestly, if we wanted to keep playing pretend courses in a low feature game - we would still play The Golf Club instead of shelling out more money for this.  Even at a low price, I over-paid for this game.<br /><br />In summary, I am positive I have wasted more money on less useful things over the course of my life, so not looking to rant on minutia, but this was a pretty disappointing effort on the part of EA",2015-08-27

Tactile response is perfect, no input lag, and decades old muscle memory came right back =)  It's the little things though that really make this so much fun.  The thing just looks dead on... that same weird shade of grey, the red, the size, the feel.  The box it came in looks like the old NES console which was awesome.  Even the paper the instructions are printed on is that weird off white that so many NES games came with.  Like the map for Startropics as an example; it was that same weird yellow / white color and feel.<br /><br />Not sure why I had so much trouble getting it to work.  This was my first bluetooth controller so I'll blame the difficulty on getting it working as my own fault.  Maybe my tips below will help.<br /><br /> - Turn on your android device and go to Bluetooth Options; I find turning off the bluetooth radio helps.<br /> - With the controller off hold the START button until both lights light up then LET GO!  Don't keep holding it too long or it gets confused.<br /> - This turns on the controller in MODE 1 which works in John NES, Nostalgia.NES, and other emulators.<br /> - You should see the blue LED flashing once ever second.  If you were in MODE 2, 3, or 4 it would flash 2, 3, or 4 times rapidly then a brief pause.<br /> - The controller is now trying to pair with any listening device.<br /> - Turn on your device's bluetooth radio or hit the Search button if applicable.<br /> - Should see some weird 1e:03:34:f4 type address pretty quickly.  You can wait longer and it should say 8bitdo GamePad.  Tap the address / name and it should try to Pair.  It may ask for a key; just put in 0000 and hit OK.<br /> - Your device should soon say it's paired and your confirmation is that the blue LED on the controller is solid.<br /> - You may need to change your Default input for your android device.<br /> - Go to Settings &#62; Language & Input &#62; scroll down Keyboard & Input Device sections and tap on Default.Select 8bitdo GamePad.<br /><br />Example I'll use is Nostalgia.NES.<br /> - Open up NES emulator and tap the options in the upper right corner<br /> - Hit the Preferences button<br /> - Scroll to the bottom and tap Select Input Method<br /> - Select 8Bitdo GamePad by tapping it.  If it's not listed you've not paired it properly.<br /> - Now hit Edit Profile<br /> - Go through each option you want to change.  Example:  touch UP and then hit UP on your controller... Most of them are setup already but make sure START and SELECT are for sure; I think those weren't setup right by default.  I also bound Y to Turbo B and X to Turbo A.  So I'd tap on Turbo B and then hit Y on the controller.  Binding L1 and R1 to save and load can be helpful.<br /> - Once you've made your updates hit the back button on your device.<br /> - Load up a ROM and it should work perfectly!<br /><br />Troubleshooting:<br /> Q: My keyboard doesn't work!  I tap into a text field and no keyboard comes up!?<br /> A: Your gamepad is technically an input device and probably your default one.  Simply turn off the gamepad (Hold START until both LEDs flash then let go!) and then tap into the text field again; you will get your standard keyboard back.<br /><br /> Q: I paired my device just fine a while back but I just tried it on and now my device can't connect to the gamepad.<br /> A: Out of batteries?  Ok yeah sorry ... of course it's not... Sometimes you can accidentally turn it on in a different mode.  For example I've had one of the buttons stick on me and then when I held START to turn on the device it wouldn't connect.  Took me a few minutes to notice that the blue LED was blinking twice rapidly then pausing.  That means it was turned on in MODE 2.  Turned it off, pushed all the buttons to unsticking it, and turned it on in MODE 1 and all was well.  Keep in mind you are pairing to the gamepad and the MODE; so if you turn it on in a MODE other than the one you originally paired it with then it won'twork.<br /><br /> Q: I swear I did everything you said and it still doesn't work; thanks... newb.<br /> A: Yeah I had a heck of a time getting it all working at first.  I had to &#34;forget&#34; the paired device and re-pair it I don't know how many times.  I tried all modes, the 8bitdo APP, firmware upgrade, etc. etc.  I think the real ticket was going into the Language & Input then setting my default device to 8bitdo GamePad.  That's when programs like Nostalgia.NES John NES would actually show it as an option when selecting input device /controller in their preferences.",2015-08-27

I love games that allow you explore and interact with the environment, collect items, and build a character. This game satisfies all of this and more! You can pick the life you want to lead (your job, basically), gain experience, collect items, and satisfy small quests. When you're tired of that, you can select a whole new life for your character and start again while keeping all the skills you learned with your last Life! As you gain more experience or try new Lifes, the way you interact with the game changes so you can do new things and go to new places.<br />I only gave it 4 stars because the actual story line of the game is incredibly lame and boring. BUT, you don't have to follow it much and mostly you can do what you want. Going through the different levels for each Life and gaining experience is a lot of fun and it has a ton of small tasks and quests that I found to be more interesting than the main story line.

If you have fast internet,"In all honesty, if you have are a PC Master Race guy with a sick gaming rig but love the idea that you can play them on a massive 4K (or HDTV) in your living room and realize that consoles are very obsolete in terms of what you get out of a PC, then this is the true console killer device. I can stream any Steam Demo ( even not mentioned in the supported titles) and much more from my PC and that is cool enough for me.<br /><br />Unfortunately here is some cons:<br /><br />1. Playing fast FPS games will display some very very minor lag, so if your used to seeing the butter smooth movements on your PC monitor with fast FPS games, you will notice a slight difference. This is due to streaming but also to the TV refresh rate. In my opinion, I will play FPS games on monitor because i'm competing against PC players and you need precision.<br />2. You must have a 5ghz router, so throw away your 2.4ghz. If your less than 50mbps your wireless gaming will suffer and you wont want to play PC streaming. Best solution, hard wire through ethernet ( maybe even drill a hole in a wall and feed it through if you can )<br />3. You will notice slight quality degradation compared to your monitor during game streaming primarily always during fast paced action, slight blur while image refreshes and catches up with the wireless signal.",2015-08-27

The actual gameplay is a blast and the first raid is fantastic, but there are a myriad of issues. The story is boring, all the NPC's constantly speak in vague metaphors, the multiplayer crucible is a lag fest with cycles of unbalanced weapons, and it can be tough to find a roster of dedicated friends. All of the people I played with originally (people I knew) have quit playing. Then I found a lot of people through LFG and eventually settled into a new group. These people also quit after the first and second expansion. Now I mostly play PvP/Trials, and go to LFG to find more rando's to play with for PvE stuff. Honestly, not a great game to start up on because you'll have to grind forever to get the good gear, and let's face it - the human brain's susceptibility to addiction will keep you playing this game LONG after you finish the story or even finish playing for the sake of a good time.  As of the next expansion, I will be joining the ranks of others who have &#34;given up the habit&#34; and walked away from this game.",2015-08-27

New WR mechanics such as Aggressive Catch, RAC catch, and Possession catch allow you to be in control of your WRs. Your user skills on defense will be tested more than ever this year.<br /><br />The new mode Draft Champions brings Fantasy Football into Madden. The mode can be played solo versus the computer or multiplayer vs other competitors. You will go through a 15 round draft to improve off of your base team. The more you play, the more you learn that some Gold players are better for you than some Elite players. You always be able to draft an NFL Legend in the final round of the draft such as Herman Moore, LaDainian Tomlinson, Ray Lewis, John Elway, Jason Taylor, Ty Law, and many more! Wins will be rewarded with content in Madden Ultimate Team. If you lose, you can begin the whole draft process over again. See if you have what it takes to be a Draft Champion.<br /><br />Madden Ultimate Team has also improved. The Journey is a chain of 100+ games and each one is a game-changing moment from a real NFL game. The Journey starts with Super Bowl XLIX and you are the Seahawks on the Patriots 2-yard line trying to rewrite History. This is just one example of the many you will face on The Journey.

Like the Telltale games, narrative and player choice are front and center, but this time around the production level is very high and the term &#34;interactive movie&#34; has never been more appropriate.  I mean that in a very positive way.  It is a true blend of video game and cinema experience, and in fact the player is given more control of the character actions and movements then I had initially expected. I expect/hope this genre will continue to grow and become much more popular.  Although there are a few weird character movement animations, for the most part the motion capture animation is quite amazing, which in turn serves to highlight the strength of the cast (true, the acting and script can be over-the-top, but that comes with the territory in this genre).<br /><br />I have played through the game completely once.  I plan to play again, and it will be interesting to see the different ways your choices can alter the outcome, though I suspect that there will be diminishing returns in repeat playthroughs as it becomes more apparent which portions of the story are set in stone and how much of the choice is illusory.  Still, just the knowledge that any of the 8 main characters can either die or survive depending on how you play the game really serves to up the ante as you creep around the &#34;cabin in the woods&#34; environment.<br /><br />Combat itself isn't a large portion of the game, but when it happens it is done through quicktime events.  One twist on that concept is that sometimes it is actually best to NOT perform the prompted action (for example, there may be quicktime event prompt to perform an attack, but it may be better to do nothing and stay hidden).<br /><br />While there are things that could be improved, this game represents a big step in the genre, and I hope developers continue and expand on the experience delivered here.",2015-08-27

This game is absolutely chilling and will grip you the moment you turn it on.,"This. This is the game that you need to own if you enjoy anything horror. I hadn't even heard of this game until I was browsing new PS4 games and realized that this one didn't even sound familiar to me. Honestly, I'm glad that I didn't know about this because if I had, I would be itching to play it and waiting for the launch.<br /><br />After reading many reviews about how awesome this game is, I pulled the trigger, drove to the store, bought it, and was instantly hooked. When I look for horror genre related books/movies/games, I am looking for something that will hold my attention and that is suspenseful, engaging, and realistic. This game is the perfect mix of all three of those. To top it all off, it is truly chilling.<br /><br />Just reading the description, I was instantly engaged: &#34;When eight friends become trapped on a remote mountain getaway gone wrong, things quickly turn sinister and they start to suspect they aren’t alone. Every choice the player makes while playing as each of the eight friends – even the seemingly trivial ones – will carve out a unique story. The player's actions alone determine who survives until dawn.&#34; I mean, come on, that's just amazing.<br /><br />Until Dawn is a game where player choice determines the outcomes in each chapter as well as the ending. With this being the case, you can literally play the game multiple times and have a different outcome each and every time. All I can say is give this game a shot. The graphics are beautiful, the sounds are even better.<br /><br />The gameplay of Until Dawn focuses on quick time events, and discovering clues. A system is added to keep progress of all the secrets you find, which can help you piece things together. It's been noted to be similar to Heavy Rain. The player can take control of each of the eight characters, and can make simple choices which will effect the way the game plays out, resulting in deaths or other mayhem. There are over thousands of different endings possible in the game.<br /><br />I'd love to hear from anyone on how they feel the game is the further they get into the story, and I will plan on doing the same.sible in the game.<br /><br />I'd love to hear from anyone on how they feel the game is the further they get into the story, and I will plan on doing the same.",2015-08-27

I still go back to play it a decade later(feel so old?). The story is magnificent. While not wholly original it is told masterfully. Interaction between you and the rest of the party and even between party members feels genuine and adds a fundamental layer to the game. The reason the story and character interaction is so exquisite is due to(now be warned) a time when all dialogue did not have to be spoken. You can skip most dialogue but you are really missing an incredibly woven story. In addition, even with the old isometric top down engine the visuals are still really lively and engage you with the story.<br /><br />The combat in the game is still not properly recreated anywhere that I have seen. Though I haven't played the latest Dragon Age so maybe its there but I doubt it. The game is tactically hard basically. In the beginning fighters are the best class but towards the end of BG1 and through out BG2 mages can just obliterate an ill planned attack. The magical combat I think is similar almost to a card game in that it incorporates a kind of countering and spells don't just recharge/cooldown. You can use magical shields, but at the same time they can be dispelled(removed) so you have to choose between using another barrier or going without. And anything the game lets you do the enemy can also do if not a bit more.<br /><br />The gameplay is immensely complex once you gain more abilities for you and your party. The closest similarity I can draw is XCOM. If you enjoyed XCOM you should enjoy the game play here. It takes a long time to get new abilities though.<br /><br />Summary<br />Excellent story with characters and interactions I still find endearing but you are basically reading a small book<br />Combat is challenging when fighting high level mages and does not have cool down timers, you use abilities once then have to sleep after a fight<br />Character level progression is almost painfully slow, which is sad because its only later when game really opens up<br />If you can take the time(and read something other than tweets) its an epic master pieceater when game really opens up<br />If you can take the time(and read something other than tweets) its an epic master piece",2015-08-27

I'm shocked by how much better this unit is than the others.<br /><br />I had a Turtle Beach 800X on my original Xbox and it was a love/hate relationship. Much of the hate was that it was tied to a massive base station for charging and that it completely failed me (even with purchased converters) when I tried to move it to the Xbox One.<br /><br />For my birthday this year, my wife bought me the 500X. The offering seemed great, but it was issue after issue. After feedback through the mic, I updated it per support instructions. It then lost complete mic ability. Support then lead me through a factory reset and re-update. It worked for a week, then just plain wouldn't turn on. I returned it for a refund and cursed Turtle Beach thoroughly.<br /><br />After much research, I couldn't find a decent option, so I decided to give the 420X, which had just released, a chance. Wow, am I happy I did.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Good sound and clarity<br />- It charges from any outlet with a USB adapter, so I can keep it near my sofa instead of at my console 15 feet away.<br />- There is no massive base station. It's a simple USB thumb drive sized adapter.<br />- Literally plug and play. Plug the USB adapter into the Xbox, wait a few seconds and you're on. No changing settings, no updates, nothing.<br />- The buttons are laid out well, and simple to use.<br />- All of the things the box says. It's fully wireless, has a good battery, mic monitoring, etc.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- I really haven't found any. I guess the sound could be a bit better, but that's really it.

I have to say I am pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />EA Sports seems to have heard most of the complaints regarding the strange, old animations, issues with the instant replay system, etc. and took a step forward to fix them. There is still the weird animation here and there but tackles, hits, they all look pretty legit now. There seems to be a lot more realism with the passing game, and to see the physical battle between receivers and defenders actually play out before the catch is really cool. The graphics are top notch, EA has taken the time to facial scan a lot of players pretty well. The stadiums, crowds etc all look really good too. Commentary is ehh, but most people don't buy Madden for the commentary. I don't play many of the modes, but from what I do play I can tell EA finally stepped up their game and didn't just make the small, incremental changes like most years. They bumped up their game, and this is the best Madden to date in my opinion.",2015-08-27

US,40685803,R1E7FJVLMS0FZ3,B000035XGB,839716031,Bionic Commando,Video Games,4,1,1,N,N,A challenging but enjoyable game,"I bought Bionic Commando in the store back in 1995 not really knowing much about it.  I had never played the NES game, but I knew that Capcom was the makers of the Mega Man games series which is the benchmark for side scrolling action games along with the Castlevania Series by Konomi and Metriod by Nintendo.  Bionic Commando is a very good action game for the Gameboy console. The password feature adds a lot to the replay value of the game.  It has lots of stages and content and a good story to boot.<br /><br />The cover looked pretty cool so I decided to give it a try.  The game is very unique because there is no jump button just a grappling hook that moves you around.  You swing like Tarzan and push yourself up platforms it is really fun once you get the hang of it.<br /><br />The first few stages are pretty standard and dull but once you get to the 4th and 5th stages the game starts to really pickup. You get weapon upgrades when you beat each stage and you get to pick and choose which armor to go with and what cannon to choose.  You don't have to beat every stage in the game to finish the game but it does help.<br /><br />The challenge is pretty good.  Your younger players below 12 years old could get frustrated and give up on the game to early.  You do have to use some strategy and master the swinging technique. You will have to tap enemy communications throughout the game to access doors and so on.  Several of the mutant bosses are difficult and put up a good fight. Often the biggest challenge in the game is grappling your way through difficult sections like the hooks in stage 7. Or reclaiming your weapons after getting captured in stage 10.  And above all the final section going underneath the Albatross engines.<br /><br />The Story is pretty interesting rescuing Super Joe and taking out a super air fortress called the Albatross.  The last major boss reminded me a lot of Mega Man X Sigma's big robotic form which came out several years later. The last stage is cool trying to race the clock to escape the Albatross.<br /><br />If you enjoy side scrolling action games you will like this game.  It has a futuristic setting and takes about an hour to an hour and a half to complete.  The password save feature is a little bit too long but it is a blessing being able to save your progress.  The game gives you lots of continues and you will die a lot later in the game but it is rewarding once you beat it with a nice feeling of accomplishment.<br /><br />Gameplay: 7/10<br />Play Control: 8/10<br />Story/Originality: 9/10<br />Challenge: 9/10<br />Replay Value: 7/10ool trying to race the clock to escape the Albatross.<br /><br />If you enjoy side scrolling action games you will like this game.

The game is much of a modern style if anything very unique blending rpg elements to a free roam type of fps combinations. The game also features a very unique style in graphics. The formula in the game represents a new 24/7 fun factor. Best part is that the game is hella long. so the goty comes with a second disc that has about all dlc's (except for costumes) this makes the game very worth gettinf because the add on content is crazy... its a whole lot. Theres hundreds of thousands of different weapons (each has its own feel) some guns are weak others are better. theres a leveling system to where you actually do feel that you have leveled up theres also some bonus stats that can boost up specific things on your character like gun accuracy, melee damage, maximum health, etc. the game also has a somewhat perk system where you unlock these certain skills (well more of a skill tree) that gives a boosts to your character (these things are important and they all help you along as you gain experience points and level up, fighting tougher enemies. The games world is just gnarly, it really makes you feel thst your in there. The story is pretty decent you will somewhat lose track of the story due to side quests youll be doing here and there but its okay each main mission will remind you where you are at. All the characters are exciting and intresting even the enemies in the game. This game is truly a gift from god. Minor complaints are that there isnt a wholw lot to customize on the specific character you pick. There will be certain parts where the game gets tough but once you level up you will often change weapons you use since they will become weaker on stronger enemies youll face but every good gun in the game (that isnt a common weapon) feels right as you see your enemies takig alot of damage. honestly this is a good game and after playing one of the dlc's and finishong the games main mission there is still a whole lot to do (and im barely at level 33) if your lookig for a game that doesnt cost alot and is very long and fun you really need to get this quickly whether new or used.",2015-08-27

Each decision you make in the story will take you down a different &#34;What if?&#34; path, all of which share certain events but are unique enough to make replaying certain parts absolutely worth it. The ending also has one of the craziest plot twists I've ever seen in any sort of entertainment, be it a video game, movie, or book.

Devs missed a lot--when they shouldn't.  trying to aim from cover often results in peeling you off the wall instead.  The blind fire itself, if you're trying to pull compound actions is pretty unpredictable.  It's really watered down the complexity of what a player can do.  For example, wanna pull off a headshot around the corner from cover and then horizontally jump away?  Good luck executing, maybe 2 of the 3 will happen, jumping--not aiming, maybe jumping and pulling of the shot in some random order.  I don't know if it's my connection but at a solid 55mb down and 5 up--I should be good.<br /><br />Everything multiplayer is sad.  Matchmaking is atrocious and takes terribly-long.  King of the Hill (annex) only lasts 1 round.  Expect about 5 minutes between multiplayer matches (finish-to-next-start).  Oh and if you make it to the finish screen after a match--the screen is locked.  You cannot exit until the next screen loads (maybe 45-60 seconds later).<br /><br />grenade physics respond as though you're shotputting a 16-lb bowling ball.  Unless you deliberately hold L-trigger to actually bolo throw the grenade--good luck getting it farther than 2-feet from you.  (use at your own peril)<br /><br />The gnasher seems to be its old self (finally a praise) but hip firing is very deceptive because if you use the direction of the shotgun as an indicator--you will be horribly misled and it's intensely counterintertuitive to fire at the center of the screen--ignoring the direction the muzzle is pointing.<br /><br />This is my favorite series of all time and I was nothing less than ecstatic to play.

Price,"Ok, so I'm going to go and make a guess here why some of the mainstream media sites gave The Order average to bad reviews. Price. At $60, gamers today expect to be entertained for 200+hours, especially in the shooting genre. You need to have multiplayer, new game plus bonuses, harder and harder difficulties, etc...and this is likely just too barebones of a game for today's new generation of gamers. For me, I don't have time to sit down with 10-15 games for over 100 hours. Those games I sit down with that long are thoughtfully chosen, and few and far between. For me, I agree that The Order is too short, but I still rate it very highly. The game is not bad, it simply may not be the value proposition at $60. For you, maybe it's $40, or $30, but to say the game is terrible, well, I feel it's extremely disingenuous to the devs at Ready at Dawn.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />- Well crafted and acted Story, that continually gets more interesting<br /><br />- Beautiful aesthetics and atmosphere, playing around with the photo mode and colors themes really highlight how beautiful the game is<br /><br />- No hud or menus really add to the story progression and gets you engrossed in the game. I put headphones on and had a really really great 3 hours session. Was completely engulfed in the story after the mid way point.<br /><br />- Really fun, visually pleasing weapons, that honestly, I wanted to play more of<br /><br />- There simply isn't enough mechanics in the game. Linear story-telling is perfectly fine for what they are trying to accomplish here. But a basic progression system, more back story, collectibles, etc...would have broadened the game's appeal.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- You can tell this is the team's first step into the big AAA title space. The Order is really basic and simple. Sometimes, that simplicity is absolutely beautiful, but sometimes it leaves much to be desired.<br /><br />-Pacing could be better as well as more gameplay variety<br /><br />-This gameplay engine is just begging for multi-player modes, horde modes, and other co-op experiences. Really, there's a lot more Ready at Dawn could have done with this engine, it seems kinda rushed out the door. The SP was well done, but it is a very barebones games, that at times, have to count as somewhat negative.<br /><br />At $20 and $30, it's really hard to knock The Order though. It's still one of if not the most visually stunning PS4 games on the market, and at times I felt like I was playing Gears of War on Playstation lol. Not sure we'll ever get a sequel, but this one is full of potential.

For those who do not know, this is a sort of port of a free to play mobile game onto the 3DS. I say sort of port because quite a lot was changed. The biggest of which is the removal of all the micro-transactions and the nonsense that business model spawns. So things like timers, &#34;premium&#34; currency, and lottery machines are gone. That alone is a major improvement.<br /><br />However, on top of that they also added in a basic story line to the game. It isn't anything special, but it might be that little extra something to motivate you to continue with the game.<br /><br />As a bonus, there is a entirely separate second game included that is themed on the Mario universe. This one seems more basic though. The mechanics all seem easier to understand, and when you start up the game it recommends you start with this version if you're new to the Puzzle & Dragons gameplay. However, I've found that it ramps up in difficulty far more sharply than the regular game. Regardless, you can play either or and your progress is saved separately so there is no harm in trying either out.<br /><br />I'd say it's a good value. You get two games in one, and there are none of those awful micro-transaction shenanigans in it. The story is simplistic/boring, and it still retains its match-three gameplay you may have seen on your phone. It's a good time waster, best played in small doses at a time.",2015-08-27

But instead I will explain my reasoning on why you should purchase this game and enjoy the many wounder for yourself.<br /><br />1. It's not a corny and goofy wanna be game; as I first thought when i saw the trailer for it. To its core the game provides moments of great suspense and interesting view point on how the game will develop throughout your session.  Moreover for the most part (except for 2 characters) the cast of Until Dawn are a likable bunch with their unique features to like and dislike.<br /><br />2. I am going to be honest with you if you are a fast paste, FPS, MMO, MOBO, or RTS type of gamer (like me), this game will not quite satisfy you because its an exploring game as well. Therefore you must set your mind in a way an RPG player might have who enjoys exploring and immersing yourself in. If you get that mind set you will start to enjoy the game, if you are stuck with a fast paste mind set you might hate the game or struggle through it.<br /><br />3. Simple to the point, it has many choices and they do weigh a great deal through the game. The choices in Until Dawn are not like some other games I played in which you might think it will impact the game progression but in reality it does nothing.  (I'm looking at you Dragon Age Inquisition)<br /><br />4. Finally I would say you will get your moneys worth, I beat the game in about 18 hours in a relax paste, and I have no regret spending 60 dollars on it.  So I would say you should buy the gameand enjoy the game charm. Thank you for reading and sorry for my poor English I am not a native speaker.",2015-08-27

US,10589108,RCA08P7U4397R,B00005CDR8,458129704,Sega Saturn System - Video Game Console,Video Games,5,2,3,N,N,Talkin' Retro gaming 20 years of Sega Saturn,"Hello out there since The Sega Saturn has been celebrating 20 years of being 1 of the most underrated consoles I'm going to put a brief overview of the system as opposed to the long retrospective in the gamer forums which I will put a link to in the comments section. In the 90's you had Sega & Nintendo competing for superiority & in the meantime you had these other companies such as 3DO as well as Atari attempting yet another comeback. 16 bit gaming couldn't go on forever Nintendo on 1 hand was smart they chose to only stick with system while working on a future system. Meanwhile Sega had add on's to try to get more mileage out of The Genesis while I like The Sega CD I will admit it was a failure cause of it's price & wasn't marketed well. Sega having The 32X about 6 months before The Saturn was due to come out hurt their credibility with the public as well retailers got tired of it. In the early to mid 90's The Genesis-Mega Drive did was very popular & had bested Nintendo on a couple of occasions so why they didn't just stick with The Genesis in 1994 & 1995 is beyond me cause it was still popular. In 1994, 1995 & 1996 Nintendo was clearly the winner with it's SNES cause they could do games with The FX chip & you didn't any add on's plus the games that came out were better & better. The Sega Saturn I believe is a totally underrated 2D powerhouse I mean so many arcade games like all The Street Fighter II versions & Street Fighter Alpha were arcade perfect. X Men vs Street Fighter was rcade perfect as well as Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 a very solid near arcade perfect port. Sega Of Japan wanted a system theat would flawlessly deliever arcade to home ports of games like Virtua Fighter & Daytona USA. In The US Kalinske wanted to get a deal with Silicon Graphics to create a graphics chip Sega Of Japan didn't like it as well in 1993 Sega was working with Sony after their deal with Nintendo fell through Sega wanted The Saturn to have both 2D & 3D graphics chips Sony wanted it to be strictly 3D & Sony went off & made The Playstation.On November 22nd 1994 The Sega Saturn was released in Japan it sold at 44,800 Yen. 200,000 units were sold in the 1st day of release. On December 3rd of 1994 Sega sent out more units cause on that day was The Japanese launch of The Sony Playstation The Saturn sold between 400,000 & 500,000 units The Sony Playstation sold 300,000 units in Japan. Although Sony would take the lead in 1995. In America Tom Kalinske announced that on September 2nd 1995 it would be Saturnday meaning it would be the launch of Sega Saturn in The United States. Sega Of Japan however mandated an early launch to give The Saturn an advantage. At the very 1st E3 in May of 1995 Tom Kalinske gave a presentation of The Saturn. It would be priced at $399 it would be bundled with Virtua Fighter a big hit in the arcade then Kalinske laid the hammer down & said \\""It's now available at Toys R Us, Babbage's Electronics Boutique & Software ETC.\\"" As well they had 30,000 units sent out. Now other retailers like Wal Mart, Best Buy & KB Toys weren't happy & they weren't in on the surprise & they didn't sell Sega Products for awhile. Which Sony turned around & sold The Playstation for $299.  The Playstation was released on September 9th 1995 & it sold more units than The Saturn even with the 4 month headstart The Saturn had. Namco who had worked with Sega for awhile went with Sony they ported games like Tekken & Ridge Racer to The Playstation cause it was easier to work with. I did go into all the technical specs of The Saturn in my retrospective of system on The Gamer Forum & why it was a harder system to program for plus I go into why Sonic Xtreme never came to be as well I talk about SNES & Genesis still being popular despite the fact there were 32 bit consoles on the market & then I go into Tom Kalinske leaving & Bernie Stolar coming in & putting Sega out of it's misery. Bernie Stolar basically came to from Sony to Sega the company saw him as an asset. Stolar didn't want Japanese RPG's & space ship shooters. He didn't think they represented the system well. Capcom had put lots of games out for The Saturn however in The States we never got a 4 MB RAM Cart I went in depth with what that did in my retrospective. The US never got games like Raident Silvergun or Lunar & why Street Fighter Alpha 3 or X Men VS Street Fighter never got a port here in The States.Bernie Stolar had this 5 star games policy to assure The Saturn would get quality games. Games that didn't get a score of 90 or more would have to reworked or dropped plus Sega Of Japan called a lot of the shots too when it came to what we'd get. I went into the issues between Stolar & Working Designs. At E3 1997 Bernie Stolar gave a speech he said  \\""The Saturn is not our future.\\"" He was focused on a 6th Generation Console so after only 2 years in The US The Saturn was on it's way out. Which doing this really damaged Sega. I'm not hating on The Saturn cause I love Sega The I had a Genesis before I ever owned a Sony console this is more about logic cause it's a shame this couldn't have been a 2nd place system or even just a strong 3rd place system. it's a great system I bought a Sega Saturn back in 09 I've owned it for 6 years it's not failed at all compared to PS1's that die as well The Nintendo 64 lasted for 12 or 13 years. So The Playstation in terms life span isn't a great & wonderful console. What I'm saying Sega just made so many bad decisions after The Genesis-Megadrive. The Dreamcast came out in 1999 I never owned 1 & 1 of these days I might invest in 1 cause that system did do well early on it was crushed by The PS2 add to the fact Sega screwed up so many times. I've heard so many good things about The Dreamcast a lot of the games look great. In Early 1998 Sega got rid of all stockpiles Saturn's by selling them for $110 & games for $10 some retailers sold it for $75 & games for $5 which I'm sure all the good games went bye bye quickly.  Some games on TheSaturn these days cost anywhere between $25 & $350 . In The US The Saturn only sold 2 million units 1 million in Europe & 7 million in Japan as it was more popular in Japan. Most people do praise The Sega Saturn as a great 2D system I you have some really solid to great games that came out in The US as well imports.<br /><br />Here's some of the games I have for The Sega Saturn<br /><br /> Tomb Raider this was a frustrating game I know a lot of people love Tomb Raider I just didn't care for it.<br />Street Fighter The Movie The Game yes a game based off the movie based off of a game it's a good game outside of the main Street Fighter series.<br />Shinobi Legions a great game it's true to The Genesis Shinobi games. Pretty much shows off The 2D power of The Sega Saturn. Plus play it with The Shibobi X soundtrack it's awesome.<br />Die Hard Arcade this was a fun game although it was short it can be beaten in 20 minutes. Great game if you have a Asciiware Arcade Stick.<br />King Of Fighters 97 I remember this being a really good game not played it in 5 years or so.<br />Street Fighter Collection it has Super Street Fighter II & Super Street Fighter II Turbo classic fighters asciiware stick is great for this game as well Streeet Fighter & Street Figthter Alpha 2 great games classics Asciiware Stick is a must.<br />Capcom Generation 5 this is basically a compilation disc of Street Fighter II, Street Fighter II Champion Edition & Street Fighter II Turbo again great games.<br />Guardian Heroes this was a well made game it's hand drawn there's different paths the game play is<br />good from what I remember this game was like $113 it's expensive & fairly rare if you know Japanese then hey go for The Japanese version of Gurdian Heroes cause it's significantly cheaper. More than likely this would be my favorite Saturn game.<br />Alien Trilogy a 1st person shooter it's a 3D game it shows off why The Saturn wasn't good at 3D however the game itself was solid basically you take the original trilogy loosely base it off of it & make a Doom clone.<br />Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 solid port of The Arcade game great game the slow down adds more of a gore effect during some of the fatalities. Once again I use The Asciiware Stick.<br />X Men vs Street Fight all I have to say about this Asciiware Stick & this game equals a perfect port.<br />Street Fighter Zero 3 now this game is the star of my Saturn collection cause Street Fighter Alpha 3 is my favorite Street Fighter game. I can't fault this game it's better than The Playstation version & well Asciiware Stick makes it even better.<br />I'll review some of these games & if you want a full in depth retrospective of this very underrated system then I'll leave a link to it in the comments.",2015-08-27

I was very excited to have a white controller and loved it right out of the box.  Now that I have been using it for a month, I can say that it does have enough issues to prevent it from being a 4-5 start purchase.<br /><br />The charge - I play maybe 5 hours a week on a good week, so I'm a casual gamer.  I fully charge this through the week and when I plan on gaming, the charge is down within 6 hours or less of active use.  I used to be able to use my PS3 controllers for over a week or more without having to plug them in.  I can't play two full nights in a row for 2-3 hours without swapping controllers.<br /><br />The L3 button sticks, or doesn't register at times.  My left thumb hurts for days after playing from having to hold the button down so hard in order for the button to register.<br /><br />An occasional delay has started popping up from between when I push a button to when the character reacts.  I don't mind much but a serious gamer might be very upset at this.<br /><br />For me it works, though a longer charge and sturdier buttons would be what it would take to make this a 5 star product.",2015-08-27

It's incredible that year in and year out, EA ships a game as popular as Madden with game breaking bugs.

The QB you can throw passes in a number of ways such as Touch, High point, and Low Point. New WR mechanics such as Aggressive Catch, RAC catch, and Possession catch allow you to be in control of your WRs. Your user skills on defense will be tested more than ever this year.<br /><br />The new mode Draft Champions brings Fantasy Football into Madden. The mode can be played solo versus the computer or multiplayer vs other competitors. You will go through a 15 round draft to improve off of your base team. The more you play, the more you learn that some Gold players are better for you than some Elite players. You always be able to draft an NFL Legend in the final round of the draft such as Herman Moore, LaDainian Tomlinson, Ray Lewis, John Elway, Jason Taylor, Ty Law, and many more! Wins will be rewarded with content in Madden Ultimate Team. If you lose, you can begin the whole draft process over again. See if you have what it takes to be a Draft Champion.<br /><br />Madden Ultimate Team has also improved. The Journey is a chain of 100+ games and each one is a game-changing moment from a real NFL game. The Journey starts with Super Bowl XLIX and you are the Seahawks on the Patriots 2-yard line trying to rewrite History. This is just one example of the many you will face on The Journey.

It may only reduce the playtime of a fully charged controller battery by a couple hours.  The headset is kind of heavy on the head.  I still haven't gotten used to it after a month, but I was using simple headsets prior to this purchase.  The Mic is super sensitive, and you may not realize it until someone says something, but everyone can hear just about everything that is going on around you.  They can hear you hitting your buttons, a distant fan, or your AC if it's moving air in your direction.  Usually, those people that complain about it, are also using Kinect Mics which feeds back on everyone.  Other issues I had were when I had to recharge one controller and move the headset to another.  For whatever reason, even if you assign both controllers to you, if you have to switch it will unassign you from the new one and the headset with fail to work.  You maybe able to hear the game, but it mutes you completely.  You basically have to hardwire your controller to the system, reassign controller to you and update controller (even if it says it's already updated), and pull the plug to un-hardwire the controller so it flashes off and on.  For whatever reason, canceling party, chat, whatever and re-entering doesn't work.  Same thing with shutting down system and restarting or turning the controller off and on.  Even unpluging the mic and re-plugging it in won't work, which some say is a popular fix.<br /><br />Some may have problems with the audio settings.  Some times they seem to adjust themselves.  I've noticed it more with chat.  You'll get on and everyone will sound distant or extremely soft; when you got off the time before everyone sounded fine.  You then have to re-figure game and chat volumes, which can become a little bothersome.<br /><br />I also do agree with a review I saw earlier, it does make your head sweat; especially around the ears.

I did do a retrospective for The Sega Saturn on the gamer forum plus just an overview for that system. Street Fighter Alpha is great fighting game especially on Saturn cause The Saturn did 2D very very very well & it was usually arcade perfect when it came to these 2D fighters. Not just that just the regular Sega Saturn Controller was perfect however The Asciiware Arcade Stick is great as well. The art style went to anime which I didn't mind it added to the game. Pulling off special moves is the same as Street Fighter II. The game is a prequel & what I consider the real Street Fighter 1. The plot is straight forward as you can get which works this is a fighting game each character has their own story such as Ryu who is being hunted down by Sagat who has hatred for Ryu cause he beat him in a fight & scarred his chest much like the beginning of The Street Fighter II Animated movie. Which instead of fighting M Bison at the end you would fight Sagat same thing if you playthrough as Sagat. Let's say you playthrough as Ken then you're final battle would be against Ryu as most Street Fighter fans know they're friends but have friendly rivalry where Ken wants to defeat Ryu since he's considered the best in the world while Ken is The US Karate Champion. There's also the introduction of Charlie who is of course Guile's friend which some people didn't like Charlie & just say he might as well be Guile while some like Charlie more to me I like them both plus Charlie's a powerhouse. Playing as him you're tracking down M Bison who will be the final battle. You with a trick you can do on the character select screen you play as M Bison & play as Akuma. Which I also like Akuma cause he's more powerful than Ken & Ryu. Playing through as M Bison you'll face a new character Rose. Playing as Akuma you face M Bison. I like Ryu, Ken & Sagat in this Charlie is really good. M Bison is ok Akuma is great. There's new character's such as Rose as I mentioned you Adon who was a student of Sagat's. Dan who is a joke character. Some Final Fight characters are in this game like Guy plus you can see some of the characters in backgrounds of certain are from Final Fight. I already mentioned Charlie was new you have Sodom from Final Fight in this game as well & finally Birdie. So this game is a lot of fun with really good to great control's learning to be a defensive fighter in Street Fighter is just as important as going on the offensive to me anyway. Cause you can get backed into a corner & you'll need to know when to attack kicking, punching & tripping the opponent & when to do a jump attack. Plus it is a good idea to learn the super moves where you do 2 quarter circles & press an attack button it's required but it helps cause if you use it & the opponent is not blocking well you can do a decent amount of damage. But when I was playing this I kept coming back to play it it's a lot of fun & if you've never played Street Fighter before & are interested into getting into these games Alpha is a good start cause it's very user friendly meaning it's easy for anyone to pick up & play & it was ported to more than just The Saturn & Playstation if you have MAME then you play the arcade version if you spot the actual arcade machine somewhere put few quarters or coins. It's on PS2 as part of The Alpha Anthology which has Alpha 1, 2 & 3. I believe The XBOX 360 & PS3 have it available on their store's. I recommend for fullest enjoyment get a fighting controller or an arcade stick. Next review will be for Street Fighter Alpha 2.",2015-08-27

US,18176251,R2FAARI3JQO9XQ,B00VFT4T5M,936171118,New Nintendo 3ds Only Fire Emblem If Special Edition Japan Import,Video Games,5,29,30,N,Y,Special Edition Items and Overview,"**You must have a 3ds that can play Japanese games as these games won't work on a NA 3ds as the 3ds is region locked.**  This review will be for the items you can only recieve in this special edition and aren't available in the seperate copies of Fire Emblem If. To see seperate opinions on these games please check their seperate pages for detailed information, but I will give slight input on each title included without trying to spoil anything.  In this box you will be recieving  -3ds copy of White Night/Dark Night Kingdom aka Birthright and Conquest in the West (Both games on one 3ds cartridge)  -2 Fire Emblem Cipher TCG cards Lucina and Marth (These are promotion cards and have special artwork not available anywhere else)  -Hardcover artbook featuring pictures of characters,settings,items etc  - Invisible Kingdom is also included as a download on the cartridge itself and a code isn't required!  How long are these games?  After beating the Hoshido and Nohr copies of the game I can tell you that it should take 30+ hours to beat each copy. These games have high replayability though and you can always replay the game using characters you didn't even try from the previous playthrough. Also when a character dies during a battle you'll want to reset (like I did) unless you're using the new Phoenix mode feature which lets a character respond the following turn.  I don't speak Japanese should I get these?  If you've played prior games in the Fire Emblem series (especially Fire Emblem Awakening) then this game will be perfect and won't give many problems playing through it. If you want to understand the story and see what is going on during the chapters or read support conversations much of the game has been translated into english and can be viewed on sites like Youtube or SerenesForest.  If I don't want the special edition which game should I get White or Dark Night Kingdom?  If you like being able to farm experience and max out supports with all your characters then White Night is the way to go. Dark Night plays more like earlier Fire Emblems (7,8,9) in that you can't go farm experience and money is harder to come by. You must chose your weapons and character growths carefully to get the most out of your characters. Both include normal,hard,lunatic difficulties so it really doesn't matter if you think the Dark Night Kingdom will be more of a challenge it's really just a matter of choice and strategy on your part. Do you like Japanese of European influenced character types? This should be the question you ask yourself when you pick a copy.  What's new with these games?  Just off the top of my head the Phoenix mode I mentioned earlier is new to the series and will help people who just want to experience the story and not have to reset the game when one of your unit dies from a 2% chance hit from the enemy (crazy but this happens to me quite a bit haha). New classes are introduced like the Puppeteer,Ninja and Oni Savage on the Hoshido side while the Nohr side has familiar classes like Warrior,Paladin,General and Beserker. Weapons no longer degrade and have unlimited uses, except staves of course. With this comes a new system where a brave sword may be used forever, but will lower the characters defense while they wield it.  Another new system is the support system being upgraded to where a character can have a &#34;S&#34; support marrying another and having a child and a &#34;A+&#34; support which will let the character change class into a class the other character has. The weapon triangle has been revamped as well including 2 weapon types at each point of the triangle like swords and magic beating axes and bows while axes and bows beat lances and hidden/concealed weapons.  Finally new features like My Castle (build your own base) and Skinship (rub characters to gain support).  Will some of the content in these copies change before release in the West?  The major thing that will probably get censored on its way to the west is the newskinship feature which is like Pokemon amie, where you pet characters with the stylus to raise support. It sounds weird, but honestly it's nothing dirty...other than some of the stuff the characters say while getting their forehead rubbed. Ages of some characters will of course be changed like a certain character being able to have a kid but being younger than the child itself! Outfits might be changed a little depending on what Nintendo of North America thinks about bikinis and the like but I don't think so. Also pictures for dlc scenes and clips might get edited slightly. The bad language will proably be changed like it was for awakening but other than that the game shouldn't get changed to much to warrent needing to import this copy.  Should I just wait and hope for a special edition in NA?  Honestly, I love this series and couldn't wait to play it so I had no regrets importing this copy. I also collect Fire Emblem Cipher cards and love a good artbook so I got this edition before it quickly soldout. I don't doubt the US getting a special edition with all three copies of the game though and would be shocked if we didn't get this edition minus the trading cards since I don't believe those will come out here...but I hope I'm wrong!  Edit 1/22/16- The special edition was released west, but it has become very hard to obtain. The cipher cards are not included since the TCG didn't make it. A 3ds pouch and artbook are included as well as the 3 copies being on a single cartridge. We have yet to see the artbook, but I'm sure it's the same images with English text since the size/cover look the same. I've also finished the 3rd path some time ago and it is indeed as long as the other two versions!   Pros and Cons:  Pros +Each game offers a huge amount of gameplay (each just as much as Awakening) +The different versions offer enough different content to justify the purchase +New classes are very interesting (especially the Hoshido side) +Phoenix mode will help newcomers to theseries adjust +Artbook is hardcover and the artwork is beautiful just like the Cipher cards included +All three games on one cartridge  Cons -Have to download the Invisible Kingdom -My Castle is hard to understand if you don't read Japanese -Hit rates on this game seem unbalanced",2015-08-27

Also, does not suffer from darkness, unlike most games similar to Until Dawn, the vey dark scenes(which is almost the entire game) things are actually quite visible when they are supposed to be. No muddy quality or ghosting due to poor post processing and lack of lighting.<br />The acting is top notch and almost all the actors are either well-known or recognizable. It mashes all the great things from some stellar games into one. The Great modeling of faces and motion capture (do you can clearly tell who the actor is and even if you don't know their name it's oh hey that's the chick from... And that's the guy who's in all that other $@&t) pf L.A. noire, not to mention the gameplay and &#34;choose you own adventure&#34; results of heavy rain 3.0 on roids and Beyond:Two Souls 2.5 on aderall. Voice acting is top tier as well.<br />What isn't outright scary and &#34;OMFG moment of shocked and aweness&#34; is just super creepy. Reminiscent of deadly premonition in parts, with a less twin peaks vibe than DP( but definitely a modern homage to classic Lynchian works especially the Frost and Lynch TP) in its own right. Just much darker and gore ridden. It's more like twin peaks, was in the pitch dark, reading an H.P. Lovecraft collection re written by Stephen King and Joe Hill whilst on a father and son fishing trip on ketamine in Alaska during dark days, watching Saw in the background while playing all the quantic dreams and telltale games rolled into a single hybrid.<br /><br />All this praise and I will say, that like almost everything, it's not perfect. Because of the gameplay design, and the scope of the ever changing action and reactions and the cost your decisions do have, I've noticed some inconsistencies (especially when doubling back and replaying certain instances over and making different choices). But it's not sloppy or overalls distracting. The immersion is rarely ever lifted. Even during the (SPOILERZ) analysis scenes were the fourth wall is clearly broken , but in very interesting and creative ways. The pacing is almost always fluid, it's just there's certain parts where your on a frantic fast paced chase or flee, and all of a sudden you get full control of your character again and while the music is straight outta a car chase from a horror movie, and your hearts still pounding from what just happened, what's in the middle of happening, and what's gonna happen, and you are literally slowly walking or walking at a brisk pace to save someone or yourself until the next cattle shoot interactive cutscene/button mashing timing sequence begins again. It's rare, but pacing flaws like this do exist but they are short enough to forgive as your right back into the action or on to the next story.<br /><br />Also it's extremely hard to manipulate the system to get the results you want. For a number of reasons. Those who play will get the sense that when answering certain questions might be good,bad or a trick, I can tell you from replaying that it's never what you think. If you think it's a trick, it's not. If you think it isn't a trick, it kinda is. If you think your being given questions solely for the purpose that those people will die depending on your answers, it's not that simple at all. The system is much more complex then it lets you believe and the recycled scenes for multiple choices is almost non-existent.<br /><br />This game is a rare Gem, as it not only lives up to the hype, it far exceeds it.

SSD would probably be amazing in this.,I was excited to get this installed since it would replace my 2TB external drive I had just sitting on top of my Xbox One. I had planned to take apart the external 2TB drive and use the hard drive inside to put into this enclosure. What I did not know was that my WD My Passport  had a proprietary usb adapter built onto the hard drive controller so there was no sata controller board. Fortunately I had an extra hard drive from my laptop which is a WD black slim 1TB SSHD. This hard drive has been working great compared to the external I was using. When I had games installed to the external they would lag hard which I had blamed the hard drive speed for since when the games were installed to the internal drive they would not lag as much. The enclosure was a little difficult to attach to the side of the console but once I figured out how the clips work it was not that bad. The only reason I did not give this a 5 star rating is the button on the side that is supposed to press the sync button on the console does not work at all.,2015-08-27

I would have enjoyed it if there had been an optional difficulty level tailored to my admittedly average reflexes, but I'm not interested in spending hundreds of hours becoming more and more frustrated when what I need from a game is enjoyment. It's a bad game that only caters to folks who spend way too much time honing their reflexes to almost superhuman levels. I have a life - I don't have time for this nonsense.<br /><br />Sorry, fans, but I'm just tired of developers ignoring folks like me when it comes to top tier titles. I want to play too, but apparently Bandai isn't interested in opening up their game to a wider audience by including options for those of us who aren't interested in (and just don't have time for) a challenge of this magnitude. After all, it's not as if the elite gamers would be forced to play the game on easy difficulty - they could still go for their challenge all they want.<br /><br />The challenge and the sense of achievement that some say this game gives are just not worth the aggravation for me: it's just a game and beating it is not that important.

Even the charging port is open and can be charged with the regular gamepad charged cable even with the case on.

I don’t have a charging stand so I couldn’t test it. Even the battery can be removed with the case on because there is an open flap in the back.<br />• Aesthetic appeal- the clear case really makes the gamepad still have its aesthetic appeal.<br />• Open circle for the buttons- I wanted to point this out specifically because it has a big open circle for the four main buttons which makes the gamepad still comfortable while playing.<br />• Easy to open and close clasps on the case.<br />________________________________________<br />Cons:<br />• Couldn’t really think of any for me.

My wife is Brazilian and we are going for 16 days in two months. I barely the Spanish I learned in high school 20 years ago (Portuguese being similar). So, I am trying to use a language learning program and it needs for me to be able to speak into a mic.<br /><br />Also, I love to game. I admit it. I am a gaming addict and proud. I use this for my home theatre PC, so I feel bad for the Xbox people who have to plug from the headphone to the xbox controller so that chat works (another reason why PC is far far superior to console gaming). I have a nice home theatre system and live pretty far from neighbours, so I can play a game or movie at proper cinema volumes without bothering anyone...except my wife when she is trying to sleep.<br /><br />So, I had to get a mic/headphone combo, and since I like gaming, I went for something of quality (I always find that it is best to get something maybe a bit more expensive, but built with good components as they will take more of a beating and last longer). Anyway, this purchase solved two of issues....being able to badly mouth Portuguese into a microphone, and being able to play games or watch a film while my wife sleeps (I am a night owl, blame it on genetic my circadian rhythm).<br /><br />How does it sound and feel?<br /><br />The headphones are built very nice and comfortably. I have big curly hair and relatively large ears as things go, and I was able to find a perfect fit over my ears and it was comfortable on my head. The felt like cloth is easy on the ears and head. The balance with the battery on the right and the mic on the left works and one notices little weight differential when on the head. The mic seems to work great. I skyped someone and they said it sounded of good quality, it works fine with the language program....now I just have to use it for teaming up in a FPS tosee how that goes. It gives a little bit of your own voice into the headphones, I guess so you know it is working and you don't scream, but don't be tricked by how loud it sounds in your ear and how it sounds for others: the sound of your voice in the headphones is subtle, but you are loud to others....if you try to make it loud in the headphones by putting it right next to your mouth, it will almost invariably cause distortion. Just put it where you can hear it a little and know that it fine.<br /><br />The sound it quite good out of the box (you really can only use a volume control and a voice to game balance (which takes some getting used to pushing on your right earpiece).<br /><br />It has quite a balance towards base even in the neutral position, so, the media setting is overload...<br /><br />But the sounds are quite lush, with a nice midrange, lush fullness (spatiality), bass is strong and highs aren't screechy.<br /><br />As to the &#34;surround&#34; and why I give it four stars (perhaps unfairly). It will never be able to compete with true 7.2 I have when using my speakers. You do get some subtle front and back cues, but it is very hard to discern if a noise is behind me or in front of me. I never have that issue with the speaker set-up. (maybe there are settings I can play with that can fix this issue, but I can't find them).<br /><br />My other beef, is that there is no PC app for the headset to tweak things. I would be happy with a eq that would allow me to set the balance I like instead of just the right headphone cushion as a eq. I would something that could I could tweak the surround to get the sound that works best for me.<br /><br />Right now, they are just drivers and you just gauge they work or not by ear, and have little discretion to adjust.<br /><br />People complain about the plastic stand for it for the money, and maybe they have a point, but it does the job and looks decent from afar.<br /><br />Great build quality, good headphone simulated surround, ease of use, just needs more tweak-ability.",2015-08-27

However, I primarily bought this game for  the multiplayer mode.  The multiplayer mode is poor, but can be fixed with patches.  To start, there never seems to be enough players online to hold a 2 vs 2 game.  A 2 vs 1 game always leads to a slaughter of the single player.  When I am able to enter into a 2 vs 2 game, it always leads to either me or one of the other players being disconnected within two rounds.<br /><br />One of the other issues I have with the multiplayer mode is that the heroes are way too overpowered.  The game is basically a rush for the hero to destroy the other player's towers as fast as they are able to build them.  This makes the game very frustrating and takes away the fun and strategy of tower building that you experience during the first person campaign.  I would be happy if they made it so that the hero is unable to destroy towers, but allows the hero to destroy the attacking army and hero.<br /><br />As I said, the first person campaign is a lot of fun while the multiplayer has the potential to be just as fun or more fun with the proper patches and fixes.",2015-08-27

I was thinking game of the year contender.<br /><br />The combat felt responsive and visceral, as did the stealth kills, as did harvesting herbs with my knife, shooting orcs in the head with my magic arrows, and generally just running around felt right.<br /><br />But everything this game does, (including the graphics and the scenery) ceases to be fun after a few hours.<br /><br />It's all very arcadey, even the difficulty. It's like the game wants you to cough up quarters every time you die. More flexibility in the quest system would have made the game more dynamic, more fun.<br /><br />Enemies can't see you until you're very close, a design choice that makes stealth kills from behind quickly feel cheap and too easy to obtain, and the longer you play, the less fun they are, and imo, stealth kills are the best part of the game.<br /><br />I also died many times because I suck / did not complete the game in the right order.<br /><br />I went off on my own, trying to take down orcs in the order I chose, and rage quit after dying 20 times in a row.<br /><br />I also did not like having to collect magic arrows for my bow. If they're magic arrows, why are they littered all over mordor for you to find? Orcs can't use 'em, orcs can't see 'em. Would have made more sense to put them on a cooldown, give you arrows for free as time passes.<br /><br />The game is, essentially, one man against all the forces of Mordor. And that wouldn't be fun, and it's not.<br /><br />The game doesn't do very many things, and what it does do isn't very good, and you're forced to repeat them over and over and over again.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this game, is that everything you'd want to do in a lord of the rings game, like visit the snowy mountains of cahardras, the dark mines of moria, ride horses across the plains of rohan, see edoras, rivendell, osgiliath, ithilien, fangorn, minas tirith, the forbidden pool, the winding stair, shelob's lair, orthanc, etc etc, you cannot do. it's just a boring endless combat game in a bland, ugly environment that you quickly become bored of being chained to.<br /><br />It squanders the rich lore of middle earth, the hobbit, and lord of the rings.<br /><br />Remember the films? the beautiful colours and the wide variety of environments?<br /><br />The unforgettable characters and villains?<br /><br />Gollum makes a pointless appearance so the ranger can choke him, because every ranger chokes gollum.<br /><br />There's this attempt to rebrand rangers as these uncaring and inhuman people.  None of that s*** is actually in the books.  But yet again, this game reinforces that bulls*** stereotype.<br /><br />None of that is here. why should anyone give a crap about this game? it's not worthy of the middle earth license.<br /><br />It's also got the bioshock vita chamber never really die thing going, which makes no sense for the middle earth universe. I quickly came to hate it, dying over and over with no point but to die again.  It's not a good sign that this is the most interesting part of the game.<br /><br />The ending is anti climactic and feels almost pointless<br /><br />SPOILER<br /><br />\\""You really want to quit?

I did not have a PS3 (had a 360) so missed out on Heavy Rain. Then when I heard they were making a game with the same formula but with a horror twist. I knew I had to get the game. After playing it through the first time. I had good intuition. I was hooked in the moment I started playing. Now the game is short. Ive heard of people beating it in one day. Which was expected considering how when a character dies they stay dead until you restart the game from scratch.<br /><br />Every choice matters no matter how small. Something trivial early in the game can determine someone's fate. Heck sometimes doing the right thing can end in a death even if you did it to possibly save one. Twice I made a choice that anyone of us would make whether make sure someone is being protected or helping someone calling for help. But it caused a person's death.<br /><br />A nice feature is in the menu is when you make a choice that leads to a butterfly affect you can view it and when something happens later in game you can see what choice led to that moment. One problem I had with the game is people compared it to a interactive movie but to me it was either a short season of a tv show or a mini series. Not because the game is divided into chapters (10 in all) but there wasn't really a central story. It jumps to a whole another story eventually and the game didn't need to have one and the other. A full game with one of the stories would have been great.<br /><br />Despite the faults after the credits rolled with the survivors reeling in (3 of the 8 survived) I was wanting more. I will of course play it again and try to have more...or dare I say...less survivors. Not that many games can say people want to play more long after the game ends. With the game being advertised as having hundreds of endings, many scenarios based on choices. The replay value is high.<br /><br />If you want a great scary game, with a good cast. Get this...but as some reviews show. Itsnot for everyone. But if you liked Telltale's walking dead, wolf among us, etc where choices matter get this. This is an amped version of them. As you can die and then start the level again in those. Like in real life death is final...or until you start from scratch. If you don't want this now, get it for Halloween.<br /><br />and remember. Anyone can live, anyone can die, everyone can live...and everyone can die<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Almost every choice matters<br />-High replay value<br />-Good actors<br />-good scares<br />-a lot of twists and turns<br />-reviewing past butterfly affects and what they caused<br /><br />Cons:<br />-short game<br />-game never really has a center plot<br />-not for everyone",2015-08-27

Great for last-gen owners of the game who miss the game or have never played the DLC before. Worst for people who have played the PC version or have owned all the DLC on last gen systems.<br /><br />Dishonored is worth your every penny... if you had bought it years ago 2012. It was a fantastic game at the time, and even now, it still is. However, for a game that came out 2012, it runs on the Xbox One of 2015 (I have no experience with the PS4 version, though I suspect it runs identically) as if it were still on the Xbox 360. Long load times, 30 FPS or less, and only *slightly* crisper graphics. This is clearly no Remastered edition. Closer to a well-done port. The Definitive edition is a sort of balance between the X360 release and the much superior PC version. Simply put, the Definitive edition is a bit of a technical disappointment.<br /><br />Okay, so I've made the game sound terrible to some people. It isn't. Dishonored itself was wonderfully polished, fun, and filled with lots of political intrigue. It would take a while to sum up all the good points of the game and bundled DLC. And believe me, the positives DEFINITELY outweigh the negatives. Newcomers will NOT be disappointed. Returning players will be pleasantly replaying a great game. But veterans will be playing pretty much the same game they've already played.",2015-08-27

They got a lot of abuse during Rocket League. The more they popped out, the looser they got to the point I just stopped using them. This was very frustrating for them to pop out during an intense gaming session/scene/etc.<br /><br />The absolute worst part is that the little tabs that hold them, would catch on the DS4's own rubber pads. These things actually ruined my left stick's rubber padding. It created a gash and it just got worse every time it popped out. Unfortunately for me, I noticed too late. It's one thing not using something that cost me $13, but another thing ruining and having to buy a new controller that will cost over $50.<br /><br />I definitely like that it has a big and wide soft grip, but I wish it had a better way of locking them in.",2015-08-27

US,17058574,R21ZU2VIPZFZF6,B011T2FO8A,149095953,Xbox One 1TB Console - Halo: The Master Chief Collection Bundle with 3 Month Xbox Live Gold Card,Video Games,4,17,17,N,N,Buying guide for Xbox One bundles,"I wanted to create a guide to help those interested in purchasing an Xbox One, since there are 8 at the time of writing. I'll attempt to keep this up to date as the bundles change. This is NOT a comparison to Playstation 4 or Wii U.  A short list of features that may interest you, current and upcoming (fall 2015), shared by all Xbox Ones (more details can be found in product descriptions and Microsoft sites) -  HDMI pass through. You can hook up an HDMI device to the back of an Xbox One to view the content from that device without changing inputs or leaving the X1 interface. This allows for split screen viewing and if a cable box or the official TV tuner, you can view the channel guide, watch TV, and set recordings.  It is backwards compatible with some Xbox 360 games. This is great for those with backlogs (like me...) or those who want to revisit finished games without having another console plugged into the wall/TV. In the fall, owners of publisher approved disc or digital 360 games will be able to play them emulated on the X1. Some X1 games also include their 360 precursors with purchase for play on the X1 in case you missed them. Gears or War Ultimate Edition includes all 4 Xbox 360 Gears games and Fallout 4 includes Fallout 3, for example. List of games and other info here - http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/backward-compatibility  It will stream content to Windows devices.  External USB 3.0 storage. This is great because, 1) you don't need to open the console and replace a hard disc to add storage, just plug in and the X1 will format the drive, 2) even disc-based games have compulsory installs and can be upwards of 50GB each, eating storage space quickly, 3) external drives can be spacious and cheap, and last but not least, 4) USB 3.0 is actually faster than the internal hard disc interface. This means that a game on an external drive will load faster than one on the internal drive, usually by a significant amount.  The bundles-  The bundles can be split into2 different groups based on onboard storage (500GB and 1TB). The 1TB bundles also include a newer controller that has a standard 3.5mm audio jack built in. There are no other functional differences. All bundles include a controller, HDMI cable, headset (with at least one exception), and a 14 day Xbox Live Gold trial membership (paid $60/year service to play online and download the Games with Gold, a monthly rotation of full games you're free to download and keep (forever for 360 games and as long as you have Live Gold in active subscription for X1 games).  1TB bundles (with rating based on what you get for the money)-  Halo Master Chief Collection 1TB bundle. $399. Standard console, plus download code for the Master Chief Collection (the four numbered Halo games in a single package). B rating.  Amazon Entertainment MCC 1TB bundle. $399.  Includes everything from the previous plus $10 gift cards for Amazon Instant Video, Amazon Digital Music, and Comixology, and a 3-month Xbox Live Gold card. You may not use all of the additional stuff, but it's still a better value than the previous bundle. B+ rating.  Forza 6 1TB Bundle. $399. Custom Forza-inspired console with racing sounds and controller, and download code for Forza 6 and extra content. As Forza 6 is a newer game than MCC (and thus more costly) I'm according this bundle a higher A- rating, though some may not like the custom design and sounds.  FIFA and Madden 16 1TB bundles. $399. I'm grouping these together because other than the type of football you prefer, they are the same. EXCEPT - It looks like the FIFA bundle won't include a headset. Both include either the latest Madden NFL or FIFA soccer game download and a year of EA access, a paid ($30/yr) service which allows Xbox One users early access to EA releases, extended demos with progress that can be saved if a full game is purchased, discounts on EA games, and free access to the Vault, currently 12 full games. Great if you like EA's games. A- rating for Madden. B+ for FIFA.  Amazon Entertainment Madden bundle. $399. Includes everything from the previous Madden plus $10 gift cards for Amazon Instant Video, Amazon Digital Music, and Comixology, and a 3-month Xbox Live Gold card. You may not use all of the additional stuff, but it's still a better value than the previous bundle. A rating.  Halo 5 Limited Edition 1TB bundle. $499. Includes custom console with Halo sounds, and custom controller, with the Halo 5 Limited Edition (steelcase, guardian figure, game download and add-on content). Why a limited edition would come without a physical game is beyond me... It may not bother some, but it will upset many. This is a higher premium than the Forza 6 bundle (charging an extra $100 for an extra $40 package). C rating.  Xbox One Elite 1TB bundle. $499. Includes a console with a 1TB hybrid SSD and hard disc for quicker load times for the items you access the most and the Elite controller, which has replaceable/customizable sticks, buttons, and triggers for the professionals or tinkerers. While the internal storage on this will be better than the standard HDDs in other X1s, the performance increase PROBABLY won't match external USB3.0 drives, due to the continued use of the SATA interface. There's little information about the size of the SSD partition and many hybrid drives don't allow you to choose what content is on which partition. The elite controller isn't yet available, but will retail for $150 (about triple the price of a regular controller). If you want the best/most storage and best controller out of the box, this is the bundle for you, but you won't get any games with it, or a headset, from the looks of it. B- rating.  500GB bundles-  Halo Master Chief 500GB bundle. $349. Looks like this being phased out. If you can get it at the retail price, I'd consider it an A-, since the cost to upgrade storage to 1TB or greater is around or less than the $50 to get the 1TB model, and it'll perform better.  Gears of War 500GB bundle. $349. Includes Gears of War Ultimate Addition download (as well as all 360 Gears games if you play online before the end of the year). This 500GB model includes the new controller, but does not include a headset. There are frequently other, short-term bundles that include an extra, game, controller, or Live for the same cost. A- rating.  Hope you found this comparison useful.",2015-08-27

Another reason is because there's a bunch of fanboys posting false reviews. Basically, I tried campaign for a few hours and some multiplayer. Both played really smooth. The graphics are really clean, it's one of the best looking games on Xbox one. For people that like the gears series, I'd say it's well worth the 40 dollar price tag. It's basically a brand new game for 20 dollars less than the usual price of a brand new game. For new comers to the series, if you like third person shooters with intense action, check it out. It's an excellent value for the price. Plus you'll get all of the other Xbox 360 versions of gears of war once those games become available for Xbox one, but I believe you need to play at least one online game within a certain time span to unlock them.

I have played every gears including Judgment which most people skipped. Personally I was hoping for a Gears 3 remaster since that would have all the improvements and modes people have demanded over the years, but they choose Gears 1. For the price I feel like if you still have interest in this game I would definitely buy again. If you have never played a gears game and you wanted to start this is a great place. Especially since in the next come months you will be able to play Gear 2 and 3 for free (Xbox 360 versions on Xbox one) this game gives you the opportunity to play the whole franchise for $40 or less depending on where you buy it. Definitely missing Horde mode right now.<br /><br />Multiplayer has felt fluid and of course you always have your pros who dominate, but that is every multiplayer game. Shooting characters in MP and having nothing happen is one of my favorite GOW memories (sarcasm). I would say the remaster and dedicated servers have improved greatly on that. Hopefully you enjoy Gears as much as I do. Great place to start before jumping into MP is the story for practice. This game has been out for years so there are some crazy good players.",2015-08-26

I work until late at night and my wife is usually sleeping by the time I get home.  This headset fits the bill perfectly.

This basically makes it a semi-wireless headset.<br /><br />I haven't had any issues with other people hearing my voice and the microphone has seemed to have help up over the past couple months of use.

There are parts where the characters don't seem realistic. Their reactions are too over-the-top or too &#34;meh&#34; sometimes. Like, someone got mutilated. You shouldn't just go back to your stuff. Other times, it's something small making a character cry. Calm down, please!!!! Also, the walking mechanics are a bit boring and clumsy at times. The environments are too dark at times, too. I have gotten completely lost, too. One time I walked alllllll the way down a tunnel before noticing that it was the wrong way because they looked the same.<br />The bad parts are very minor, but I wanted to tell you them. This review was very quick, but I need to get back to the game. I've almost beat it!!!! And you bet your last dollar that I'll do it again!!!!",2015-08-26

When researching Until Dawn, you'll read about how no one playthrough will be the same as another because of the deep butterfly system that can alter the plot based on the most minor of choices. In fact, one professional review mentions hundreds of different endings and thousands of branching points. Sadly, this is not the case.  The interesting part is that first time players will be captivated by Until Dawn. The story draws you in at the beginning and it makes you feel like your choices actually DO matter. However, once you reach the end, it becomes clear that much more of the plot is set in stone regardless of your decisions than was previously advertised. It's hard to go into detail without mentioning spoilers, but the ending with a playthrough where everyone survives versus one where everyone dies are actually incredibly similar. As a result, this game has stunted replayability. Furthermore, the playthroughs that were originally said to take around ten hours or so clock out closer to six or seven hours.  Is Until Dawn a bad game? No, not at all. If you enjoy the Telltale series, you'll definitely get a kick out of it. However, the devs and a lot of reviewers seem to have blown a lot of aspects of this game out of proportion, thus creating expectations based on a work of fiction.",2015-08-26

US,44605942,R3MLEGOWMUNQ5W,B00JUHZBRG,540741509,Dragon Age Inquisition,Video Games,4,2,3,N,Y,Played through six times so far,"I've played this through six times now, and feel as if I can share my thoughts on it fairly well at this point.  Initially I had trouble.  I had a brand new computer, specifically for gaming, but when I tried to play this, it kept saying I didn't meet the requirements.  It seems some sort of security feature was blocking the game.  A clean boot fixed the issue and the game worked great after that.  So, if you have trouble getting started, I recommend googling how to do this.  The graphics are absolutely gorgeous.  I had to stop and show my husband at one point when my party was in a desert setting, looking at their shadows across the sand.  It is stunning.  The graphics are so amazing that they gave me pretty bad motion sickness at first.  It took me a few times playing to realize that was what was making me sick.  Unfortunately the only thing for it was to take breaks.  The good news is it got better.  Dramamine helps!  I've heard that maybe a tenth of people have this issue, so chances are good you will not be one of them.  The controls are very different than the previous two Dragon Age games.  I'm not sure why this decision was made.  If you go straight from Dragon Age 2 to this one, you're going to feel very awkward at first, until you get used to it.  If you happen to play Dungeons and Dragons Online, the controls are ALMOST identical to those in that game, so you'll find this very easy to get used to.  I don't care much for the tactical camera, so I can't tell you a lot about it, but the similarity to DDO was helpful to me.  One thing I did like is that you can hit the letter &#34;R&#34; to do a basic attack, and holding it down will keep you repeating that.  And the letter &#34;F&#34; is your &#34;use&#34; button.  It all means fewer mouse clicks, which makes things go smoother, in my opinion.  In the past two games, you had six NPCs to choose from.  Two warriors, two rogues, and two mages.  In Inquisition, you have nine.  They are all very &#34;human&#34; (even if they're not), well developed, complex characters.  But in my opinion nine is too many and it's impossible to get the most you can out of all of them in a single game.  Multiple play-throughs is the only answer.  I've played through several of the romances, but not all of them yet.  I have yet to romance Josephine or Cassandra, but I will probably get around to it eventually.  All of the romances are interesting and provide a lot of extra insight into the NPC you are romancing, with one exception.  The Solas romance has barely any content.  Four scenes, to be specific.  There is much more there with everyone else.  I found it a major letdown.  That said, there are many people online who are quite fond of that romance, so if you find yourself quite taken with him, and if he seems into your character, enjoy.  One other thing I'm less thrilled with, regarding the romances, is that some characters do have limitations regarding who they will be with.  There are some characters who will only romance a particular gender, or certain races, much like in the first Dragon Age game, although I realize that one didn't limit you based on race.  In my first play-through, which I did while avoiding spoilers, I was disappointed to realize the person I most wanted to romance was unavailable to the gender I was playing.  While there is a great deal of criticism of Dragon Age 2, one of the things I had really liked about it was the fact that you could romance whoever you wanted, regardless of your character's gender.  Something I do think is an improvement, however, over the past games, is that it makes very clear when you have an option of beginning a romance with a character, and you can choose not to do so without getting into an awkward situation that makes them get upset with you.  In that first game, I found it impossible to turn down Zevran and Leliana without earning a great deal of disapproval, and chances were good that eventually you would have to either do that or just be with them.  I was not thrilled with the Inquisitor specializations.  Every one of them was already being used by one of your NPCs.  In the past games there were options that were not necessarily already being used by an NPC, allowing you to avoid redundance, even if it is a matter of flavor.  The specializations are fun, but you're going to match some NPC's path no matter what you choose.  Except that it will be harder for you to get your specialization than it is for your NPC, so chances are good that whatever you have, there's an NPC who is better at it than you, unless you specifically avoid advancing your NPCs in their specializations.  Something else I liked about Inquisition is that you can feel free to move the plot forward, and you will still have access to all of your previous quests.  The exception being the end of the game.  It tells you that you can continue to play after you've done the final plotline, and this is true, but there will be no more dialogue between yourself and the NPCs, and it really feels as if it doesn't count.  Just save the final plot point for last, which seems rather obvious.  Well, that is everything I can think of!",2015-08-26

Still, EA fails to make simple overhauls Madden fans have been clamoring for the last few years. The in game commentary is the same old song and dance, relocating a team is not as fun as you'd think as they didn't change any name choices and hardly any uniform options from '15, and running the financial side of a team feels hollow and unsatisfying. The new scouting system is fresh but at the same time does not really help you effectively identify the best players in a draft class.<br /><br />The in game experience is fun, though defensively it doesn't really feel like you have any control over the game.

US,27111413,R1J5KNPMZNQXEC,B002I092MM,976442722,Super Mario 3D Land,Video Games,3,0,1,N,N,easy game made annoying by awful camera,"My save file has 5 sparkling stars, so I can't claim this isn't a fun game considering all the time I've sunk into it....<br />However, it has major flaws.<br />1. First, the forced &#34;2.5-D&#34; perspective or whatever the technical term is. I HATE the camera in this game. This game is very easy. The challenge exists solely in how much you're not allowed to see from moment to moment. The camera swings around to different distances and angles constantly and arbitrarily, preconfigured on a track made by the game designers. Most often, it only moves when Mario moves, so if you're in an area and there's a enemy just offscreen, the camera won't back up to allow you to see the enemy until you walk to where the enemy IS! Did it kill or hurt you from offscreen in your moronic quest to get permission from the camera to see it? Screw you, love - the game makers. There's a boss battle at the end of the game with a boss trolling the far wall and a boss trolling the near wall. If you inch forward at all, the camera zooms past the near enemy to focus on the far wall. You have to hit one boss then the other until both are dead. Not really hard at all. Except the camera will not allow you to see the near wall enemy unless you move Mario all the way from the far wall to the near wall. This is beyond annoying because trying to attack the near boss when the game won't allow you to locate it is not hard, it's stupid. The camera pulls back far enough to find the boss only after you moved close enough to be in it's attack range. Infuriating. Not to mention the camera zooms to the left or right side of the room depending on where you are, so you never know why you still can't see the near enemy. Do I need to move toward the center or closer to the camera?...oh I died.<br />Another common instance is often the in-level shift from &#34;3d&#34; to &#34;2d&#34;. You'll be humming along in a level with the camera showing you depth, then randomly it'll pan to show the classic 2d perspective.Having removed your ability to perceive depth, the game then kills you because while navigating obstacles you pushed Mario too near or far from the camera and fell off the platform. There's no way to know this is happening until you're watching the death animation. The camera stinks.<br />2. Lousy bosses. There are two bosses in this game. Bowser and the spinning/boomerang twins. That's it. Them over and over and over.<br />3. The death system. I don't get this. If I start a level with a suit and then die, I'm immediately put back at the start of the level without the suit. For the impatient, you can try the level that just killed you except in a weaker state. If you wanted retry the level with your suit back, you had to quit to the main menu and reload your save. Huge waste of time. I did this every time I died. The game rewards this behavior btw. I was never offered the super tanooki suit because the game never knew I died on a level 5+ times. If you use the super suit even once, you can't get shiny stars on your save file. I understand being precious with suits to reward good players in NES Mario because there's no save file. Except this is a level based game. If I want to play a given level with a specific suit, I shouldn't have to play another level, retrieve the suit I want, take that suit in the overworld so I can try the other level suited up. That's not rewarding anything.<br /><br />Playing this, I kept reminiscing &#34;remember all those super fun times you died in NES SMB or SM64 because the camera wouldn't let you see where you were going? Ah the memori...wait, that never happened! Those games were actually good!&#34;",2015-08-26

Play the original,"Gears Of War the original was the reason I purchased an Xbox 360. I can still remember my first time seeing the Mad World commercial, turning off the tv and proceeding to the nearest Target. This remaster is a complete let down. As much as I have heard complaints about the Halo Master Chief Collection (Multiplayer, XBox Live, etc), the gameplay itself was solid. Which brings me to Gears. I could hardly play through the first 10 mins of this game. I looks like they just cobbled a bunch of higher resolution textures together and scripted it along with a few sound effects. This remaster is amateur at best.<br /><br />Sound.<br />Horrible. Everything is level, the explosions, the voices and other effects have no depth. Its as if you are listening to the game through some tin cans. There is even  a slight echo in the character voices as if they are in a sound booth... smh<br /><br />Effects.<br />Amateur. Here is an example of how poorly done the effects in the game are. I noticed that while shooting that the bullets seem to have the same travel and collision effect no matter how far the object I was shooting was. I shot a wall next to me and turned and shot a wall, a car, and even the ground distances ranging from near to far and it looks like the bullets go about 10ft and collide and disappear. The game also has poor depth perception between the characters. I would compare this to playing one of those poorly made javascript games online in your browser.<br /><br />Graphics.<br />This is where the game stands out. While you are standing still the game looks beautiful. The visuals and imagery looks great, but moving around ruins this effect.<br /><br />Overall this game looks and feel last minute and rushed. As I type this, i cant help but have the feeling that the developers did not care to remake the actual campaign portion of the game and opted to dedicate all or their resources to the online multiplayer. This sucks because I can care less for the multiplayer aspect of the game.",2015-08-26

US,6017141,R2XF6AHSUCQUUH,B00IL92TSI,722987445,2x New Gen Replacement Controller analog Stick Thumbsticks thumb stick for Sony Dual Shock 4 PS4,Video Games,3,6,8,N,Y,Burning Rubber Sticks,"These analog sticks work great for their price, however you may want to know a couple details before purchasing. 1) Adding Rubber Grips - (Short Answer)  Was not able to use rubber grips.   Starting with completing an easy installation I immediately put on rubber grips in attempt to decrease ware for the thumb sticks.  Then proceeded to jump into playing a game, immediately finding that the hollow centers of the analog sticks did not have a proper depth resulting in a massive amount of friction from the underside of the rubber grip against the controller.  I then tried to pull the thumb sticks a bit out only to find they went to the same position after clicking the thumb stick down multiple times and if I pulled the thumb sticks out to far there would be friction from another part of the inside of the controller rubbing against the spherical part of the analog stick.  End result, removing the rubber grips. 2) Play time and level of wear - (Short answer)  Will wear quick if you play a ton, but have no reason to believe they will if used casually.   I began using these twenty days prior to this post.  I cannot give a proper number estimate in which I have used these, being that It would cause mental anguish realizing the number of hours I have spent these past twenty days playing video games.  However, I can paint a quick picture.  I am a full time college student who is a massive introvert and on a summer break free of obligation.  Spending a day (7-9 hours) on video games feels like a blink and I more often than not plan on waking up the next day and starting again.  This level of milage took the rubber part of the thumb sticks straight off the plastic center stiff portion of the thumb sticks.  They still work, but the rubbery portions fold down when shifting/moving the weight of your thumbs to dictate the movements of your in game avatar.  In conclusion, these thumb sticks are great for their price, but may not be the best fit for you if you put in an excessive amount of hours in video games and want a thumb stick that will last a long time.",2015-08-26

US,51165959,R1ET4BICLKMO5M,B00J48MUS4,928566066,Assassin's Creed Unity,Video Games,4,2,2,N,N,Not so bad if you didn't buy the game at its initial release,"I bought and played this game some 6+ months after its initial release and actually found it very enjoyable with most of the major glitches now patched.  Obviously, Ubisoft is still a money-grubbing corporation that should be ashamed of releasing an incomplete game.  But for people that got the game upon its release and gave up due to the glitches, I would suggest giving the game a second shot.<br /><br />So here are the pros and cons in easy to read bullet point:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* Lots of different things to do: Like most of the Assassin's Creed games, there are lots of side quests and little things to occupy your time between story missions.  I actually thought the murder mysteries and the Nostradamus puzzles a fun departure from the regular beat-them-up side quests.<br />* Eagle Vision becomes more useful: Up until this game, I've never really had to use much Eagle Vision asides from finding Glyphs and because the games told me to.  With more enemies and the ability to go inside buildings and underground, Eagle Vision becomes more important in knowing where enemies are.<br />* Multi-player missions are a challenge: I confess that I played all the multiplayer missions as a single player (I don't play well with others).  And yes, single player is an option that you can access through the world map.  The ones where you have to remain undetected for highest level of reward can be frustratingly fun.<br />* Graphics are an improvement: The city of Paris looks beautiful here.  The cut scenes are also vast improvements over previous games where the characters just look plain terrible and their lip movements often don't match the sound.<br />* Better economy system: The game does a good job of not giving you too much money too fast.  I thought that was actually an issue with previous games where you have so much money that you can buy all the gear you want plus all of Rome halfway through the game.  With the different level treasure chests, there are actuallya good amount of money that you won't have access to initially so it forces you to make trade offs between improving your theater (which will slowly give you more money) or buying gear.  It also helps that the top level gears are very expensive.  Even at the end of the game, I cannot afford all the available gears and their upgrades.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* Boring story: The major players in the plot are all so interchangeable.  One old white French guy look like all the other old white French guys.  **spoiler** And at some point in the story, Arno is kicked out of the Assassin order but then it seems like it was never brought up again and he went on being an Assassin **end spoiler**  Even though I recently finished this game, I can't tell you what the story actually was about.  Something about helping his Templar childhood best friend avenge her father?<br />* Terrible character movements: Upon first playing Arno, I felt his movements to be incredibly clumsy when compared with Altair, Ezio, or even Connor.  The controls felt unresponsive and trying to get Arno through a window can be super frustrating while trying to be stealthy.  For a game where probably 95% of getting around is by climbing and jumping, having unresponsive controls makes the gameplay pretty unenjoyable.<br />* Messy, complicated menus: It was difficult for me to figure out how to navigate the in-game menus.  During the Nostradamus puzzles, it would be nice if the clue stayed somewhere on screen or is easily accessible some way.  To this day, I don't have a clear idea of how to access those clues except by looking through several screens of menus.  Same goes for any option to quit a mission.  I had to look that up online.<br /><br />So my conclusion is that this is a pretty fun game.  The missions and side quests are enjoyable and the graphics look nice.  The most frustrating thing about it is probably Arno's movements and how unresponsive the controls are.  I typically don't care a lot forstories, so having a boring story doesn't hurt my opinion of the game too much.  I just wished I knew who I was killing and why.",2015-08-26

Let's see, everytime !  I immediately sell it and wait for the basketball g9ames.<br /><br />If you are super hardcore Madden guy that plays annually looking for full breakdowns maybe try another review.<br /><br />From the jump, nice cover choice.  However wasn 't this kid a rookie last season ? Quite an Ode to Odell I'd say he's gotta be geeked to see himself on the cover and with three different moving animations on the title screen.  Last year that Seattle title screen was cut and pasted by a child.<br /><br />Probably the best news to me is the new Draft Champions mode.  You draft a 15 round  draft and fill your team up that already has 50-70 rated players.  These players range from high 70's to high 80's, and close off the 15th round with a legend.  It's really nice that each round gives you deptch chart beneath each player, very slick ! If you win three games you go to SB.  If you lose more than one game you're done.  You can play offline or online.  Here's the best part, it replaces MUT, and the craziness of building legend teams that gets so outta hand.  I will still play MUT but this is a way better idea to me, cuz I'm not about to pay out of my pocket towards chasing legends.  Also, why buy the deluxe or super deluxe editions unless you are a MUT freak.  Thanks Draft Champions !<br /><br />The opening game sequence is very cool, with different endings that gets you hyped to play.  However your mom could suceed in its format it's more like a cutscene button push.<br /><br />Gameplay is exciting again with playmaker ability for catching and defending.  That alone is a huge improvement on stale gameplay of the past.<br /><br />I started and ended my connected franchise because I'm really too busy this week, didn't want to take simmed losses.<br /><br />Graphics are almost too good with camera panning in and out at well choreographed times is great but dang so much movement on the screen at times it's a eyeball meltdown.<br /><br />I usually play on all pro, but I went back to pro so I can basically start over.  I have really missed out on many years of changes to controls. It's a bit overwhelming honestly if you haven't played in a while full force.  Basic gameplay is easy to recall, but it's all the micro adjustments at the line of scrimmage that have me a little overwhelmed.<br /><br />Wrapping up.  It plays well.  It's fun again.  It looks great.  This is the first year I didn't have instant buyers remorse.  This is a year you might want to consider downloading the game.  Clearly I was impressed.  I gave it 5 stars, maybe if you were a annual Madden big shot you could give it a 4 cuz other than Draft Champions and playmaker it's the same game, but there's so much polish and the gameplay gets such a big boost.  All of you waiting for a legit Madden to jump back in, this is the year.  Trust me I'm a Madden pessimist.  Jump back in !n all pro, but I went back to pro so I can basically start over.

If you enjoy interactive movie type games such as Heavy Rain (PS3) and Indigo Prophecy (PS2), you'll love this game. This game is primarily about telling you a story where you make decisions that could impact how the story unfolds. So don't expect a first person shooter or action type game. You will walk around the map finding clues and watching cutscenes with minimal action buttons in between.<br /><br />Bugs:<br />For a day one release, I am pretty impressed. It seems the last several games I have gotten day one have been packed with bugs. Not the case with Until Dawn. I haven't encountered a single hiccup, restart, or freeze. And I don't really recall even downloading a patch when I put the disc in.<br /><br />Controls:<br />Again, for a day one release, I have not encountered any control issues. Pretty basic stuff as far as walking around with the left analog stick. The right analog stick moves the camera ever so slightly. A triangle here, a circle here, and a few Xs. They even incorporated the use of the pad in certain scenes. Nothing really advanced or hard to get used to. There's even a little tutorial as you're moving around to tell you what controls to use.<br /><br />Story:<br />The story is what this game is all about. The story is pretty similar to a typical horror flick. A group of teens, a few cabins in the woods, and a killer on the loose! Several scenes are designed to make you jump and the really good ones will record you if you have a Playstation Camera attached. Don't worry, by default this setting is turned off, so you will need to turn it on in the options if you want to see a playback of the scene and your reaction.You do get a chance to play as each of the characters with no option of switching between them. Each character has their own sort of story as they split off from the main group. So far, I haven't been too attached to any of the characters. I feel like that's onepart that could have been improved on. That said, the overall story is keeping me interested and wanting to find out more.",2015-08-26

In the 80's, 90's, and even early 2000's, these dominated the horror film market, giving viewers increasingly absurd and implausible situations to watch teenagers get hacked to bits over. That's an oversimplification, of course. There were dozens of genuinely good movies that took the formula and twisted it around in fun ways. &#34;April Fool's Day,&#34; for example, or &#34;Sleepaway Camp,&#34; &#34;Scream,&#34; and maybe even every &#34;Friday The 13th&#34; after the sixth one. The point I'm making is, this is a genre in need of some love. All we get now are the same ghost stories, the same &#34;found footage&#34; flicks, ad nauseum. The only thing in recent years that's truly impressed me was the gleefully chaotic &#34;Unfriended,&#34; and that wasn't even a &#34;proper&#34; slasher flick. So, with Supermassive Game's much-hyped &#34;Until Dawn&#34; presenting itself as a sort of interactive slasher movie, I got pretty giddy with excitement. But is it another &#34;Night Trap,&#34; the deservedly ill-fated Sega CD &#34;game&#34;? Or is this finally the resurgence I've been waiting for?<br /><br />The answer is &#34;sort of kind of,&#34; but don't let that sound like a knock against the quality of this riveting little thrill ride of a game. Because, up through the very last moment, &#34;Until Dawn&#34; delivers not only more scares, more twists, and more ridiculous gore than most modern horror films, but manages to hearken back to the PS2 glory days of survival horror while it's at it. It's the best of modern and classic horror films, while still managing to be a surprisingly proficient game in its own right. Oh, and did I mention that it's horrifying? Because it really is.<br /><br />Truthfully, the set-up is perhaps the most benign and predictable out there, at least as far as these sorts of affairs go. Some teenagers go to a remote ski lodge one year after two of their friends bit the dust, trying to rekindle the flames of their friendship. Of course, most of them are also trying to get laid, because this is a horror joint and of course they are. Sadly, not one, but two masked maniacs are there to try and put a damper on their fun, to the tune of flamethrowers, &#34;Saw&#34;-style death chambers, and trained wolves. Also, ghosts, Also, ambiguously cannibalistic monsters. Also, ancient Native American spirits. Yep.<br /><br />The thing about &#34;Until Dawn&#34; is that none of it makes any sense until about 3/4 of the way through the game, and believe it or not, that actually works to its advantage. Instead of being content to scare players with one consistent threat, there are numerous forces to contend with, and none of them feel like they have any connection with each other. What does a ghost have to do with a perverted man in a clown mask, or a flamethrowing maniac with malevolent mountain creatures? More than you might think, actually, and that's where the true strength of &#34;Until Dawn&#34;'s narrative comes to the forefront.<br /><br />In 2012, &#34;Cabin in the Woods&#34; took every horror movie trope imaginable and mashed them together, then gave the most cop-out and ludicrous reason why they were all there. Of course, that's a great movie, but it went really far with the absurd comedy. &#34;Until Dawn&#34; does the polar opposite. It takes every horror trope imaginable, then gives a completely plausible and compelling reason why, exactly, all of them decided to converge on this particular night and assail this particular set of teens. The late-game twists aren't actually funny... at least, not intentionally. Everything feels very sincere and authentic in its attempts to weave a yarn, and that's something I admire. It's not cheap. It's not a satire. It's horror, through and through, until the very end.<br /><br />That counts double for the gameplay as well, which is a glorious and satisfying return to older survival horror games. Cantered camera angles, slow controls, selective lighting... it's all here, recreated in loving detail by a developer who obviously cares about the genre. Even the best new horror titles either take a first-person view (&#34;Alien: Isolation,&#34; &#34;P.T.,&#34; ) or an over-the-shoulder view (&#34;Dead Space,&#34; &#34;The Evil Within,&#34;) when it comes to guiding the player. Not &#34;Until Dawn.&#34; The camera is perpetually at a fixed angle, bringing to mind the vintage &#34;Silent Hill&#34; or &#34;Resident Evil&#34; titles. However, because this is 2015, the controls are more responsive, more smooth, when it comes to directing characters to their potential demise. It takes an aspect about older horror games that I positively adore, them modernizes it in a way that I had previously thought to be impossible.<br /><br />But where the gameplay diverges a bit is in the combat. Namely, there isn't really any, outside of some context-sensitive events, which play out very much like a game helmed by David Cage. However, this is Cage gameplay in the hands of a developer who actually knows what they're doing, so the result is a game that doesn't feel like an interactive movie. In PS2-era survival horror games, confronting the threats at hand would lead into bouts of janky combat that sometimes worked, sometimes didn't. I have a soft spot for that gameplay, but it just doesn't hold up in this day and age. &#34;Until Dawn&#34; takes the survival horror mold, rips out the combat, and replaces it with quick-time event segments. Now, I really hate modern gaming's reliance on QTEs, as I usually feel like it's just an excuse for lazy game design, but in the case of this game, it actually works. They're not abused, and when they're used, it feels urgent and tense. And, most importantly, you usually see immediate consequences for failing them. Characters will lose items, get hurt, and sometimes straight-up die if you miss prompts. In most games, players will just see a slight riff on the same basic flow of events. In &#34;Until Dawn,&#34; the central gimmick of &#34;you control who lives and dies&#34; ends up feeling like a fulfilled (and tense) promise as opposed to marketing hype-speak.<br /><br />That could be said of this whole package. Everything about the way &#34;Until Dawn&#34; has been marketed made me think I'd despise it. &#34;It's an interactive slasher movie,&#34; they said. &#34;It has cutting edge visuals and well-known actors,&#34; they said. &#34;It'll make you scream out loud,&#34; they said. I scoffed at all of this, but I was proven wrong. This game is a subversive and truly disturbing take on slasher films, and takes some totally out-of-left-field twists near the end that made me cackle at their absurdity. It has some truly gorgeous visuals, perhaps the best on the PS4, aided by a haunting and masterful art direction and some stellar performances from Panettiere, Rami Malek, and, most importantly, the inimitable Peter Stormare. And, all tied together with tense gameplay that blends old-school progression and new-school action, the result is a tense, terrifying experience that made me actually cover my eyes and scream out loud more times than I'd like to admit.<br /><br />&#34;Until Dawn&#34; was something that I went in expecting to hate every hour it dragged on, but instead, I found myself hanging on every second, even through the ending credits. The scares feel very real and palpable. The threat of permanent death is around every corner. The plot keeps you guessing even after the game wraps up. Simply put, Supermassive has taken my favorite type of interactive horror experience and modernized it, crafting something that genuinely scares and feels like it has a lot of love put into it. Aided by a great deal of replay value, the whole package feels like the rare AAA, &#34;cinematic&#34; game that never loses sight of being a game, and the result of that is the scariest game that will probably come out this year, maybe even within a few years.<br /><br />Slasher movies may be past their heyday, but if &#34;Until Dawn&#34; is any indication, enough people still care to keep doing novel, clever, and, most importantly, scary takes on them. Only, this time, we got a stellar horror game instead of another movie. And truth be told? I'll take it.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- A twisty and absurd story that shocks through the ending.<br />- Loads of replay value that's organized in a steamlined way.<br />- Tense gameplay that feels interactive and not passive.<br />- A great throwback to older titles with some fresh twists.<br />- Beautiful visuals that render an excellent art direction.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- The early hours are deceptively simple.<br />- Absurd late-game twists might not impress everyone.<br /><br />Score: 9.25 (out of 10)of events.

US,40086499,R3NGUO8VF9FZLF,B00MV7KVP4,92208606,Until Dawn  - PlayStation 4 [Digital Code],Video Games,4,0,1,N,N,The best horror movie of 2015 not in theaters,"Styled after cheesy teenage slasher films, Until Dawn follows eight kids reconnecting at a remote chateau one year after two of their friends vanished. Following horror clichés, everyone is horny for each other and the melodrama is laid on thick until eventually the lights go out and bodies hit the floor.<br /><br />Until Dawn is the interactive movie style genre taken to its most extreme. Gameplay is limited to exploring small areas, examining clues, and making binary dialog choices at key moments. Each character has different attributes that dictate their honesty or bravery as well as their relationship with the other characters. Some action scenes call for quick time events including aiming a weapon or holding the controller still.<br /><br />What makes this game truly unique is that your choices --actually-- matter. Addressing a criticism with Telltale or Quantic Dreams games, Until Dawn features an element called &#34;Butterfly Effect&#34; where your choices have an impact on following events. Practically drawing from games like The Witcher or Alpha Protocol, your actions (or even inaction) won't have a noticeable effect until make later. This is all tracked in-game with a handy menu that shows what choice you made and how it effects the flow of events that follow. You can't replay sections until you beat the game: once you choose that's it.<br /><br />Until Dawn revels in its genre. Aesthetically it pays homage to modern horror like Saw with the tongue-in-cheek self awareness of Scream, the cinematography and pacing of Halloween, and the sex charged melodramatic characterization of Friday the 13th. Horror movie fans will find something to like and it makes a great game to play with non-gamer friends who scream out suggestions for choices. Visually it's above average with realistic yet creepy facial capture (Peter Stormare's character being a standout) and suitably detailed locations although the occasional framerate hitch can pull you out. The acting and writing swings from excellent to laughably terrible. It's hard to tell how self aware everyone was as the subject matter is treated seriously even though a scene could be two girls literally shouting &#34;SLUT! WHORE&#34; for five minutes. Again, standard teenage horror movie fare.<br /><br />I hesitated to pull the trigger at $60 but Until Dawn is a surprisingly content rich game. If you're going for 100% you've got 16+ hours ahead of you. People put off by titles like Telltale's The Walking Dead or Life is Strange won't find much to but both horror fans and adventure game fans will be right at home.",2015-08-26

They really went all out fixing in game mechanics here, the fight for the ball while it's in the air feature is amazing, and unlike Maddens of the past, this one actually got the defense right! No longer can a rated 70 tackle block a rated 90's defensive end perfectly, or an offensive line block for ten seconds every play (it happens, but like in real life, it doesn't happen often), meaning you have to keep a tight end or a halfback in to block if your line isn't very good. The entire physics of the game is just amazing, and it takes strategy to win a game, not just chucking the ball on a post route every other play to get massive yards, the defense will stop things you do often, like in real life they adjust as the game goes on. The offense also has a few new pocket and qb features that make things feel much more real. 5 stars for that.  Now onto why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Franchise mode is pretty much how it was last year but with a new face. However I will say the new drafting method (which include combine numbers) is cool, as well is the player progression, no longer can a rated 69 guy jump to the 90's in one season. Also, there is no defensive assignments which is out right ridiculous! It makes playing online horrible cause people just put their best receivers on my linebackers, where as if you had defensive assignments, you could put and keep your best corner on their best receiver all game.",2015-08-26

This title comes with the Metal Gear Solid Legacy Collection for PS3.  As great a collection as it is, this game should never be a part of the Metal Gear canon.

I didn't find the gameplay too challenging, but I threw in the towel when I had to fight the tank in the desert.<br /><br />Apparently, the only weapon that can destroy the tank are mines.  I had 10 mines on me, and they weren't enough to take it down.  You REALLY think I'm going to go back through allllll those rooms and look for a supply of mines??  You gotta be kidding me!  They could at least have some mines to raid out of a truck at least 2 or 3 screens away!  But nooo....  The best part is that mines are the ONLY weapon that could do damage to the tank.  Grenade launcher?  Nope.  Remote-controlled rockets?  NOPE....not even those damage the tank.<br /><br />You would think that the people who developed this game could reasonably assume that other heavy-duty weapons other than mines would damage a tank.

I have been looking for a quality headset that could be used for games and movies, and had the following features: wireless, quality sound, surround sound, and mic.  The funny thing is that I found everything I needed [for my PS4] for $80.  There is no doubt that the best headphones/headsets are wired stereo cans.  However, having a console setup can get complicating due to wires and the need of a headphone amp if plugging cans via the PS4 controller.  This is where the preference of a wireless headset comes in.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Quality Sound for movies and games<br />No bass distortion<br />Hidden mic<br />Surround sound (best I've heard for a console; PC users - look into Sennheiser PC 363D)<br />Game/chat volume adjustment<br />Simplest setup (just plug in USB receiver; no cables needed)<br />Wireless<br /><br />Cons:<br />None at this point<br /><br />This review is not about saving money, getting the best value, not spending too much money, yada yada.  This is the best headset [for a console] that I have owned to date.  For those of you wondering what other products I have used, please see below.<br /><br />Astro A50's - Sound quality is horrible; I went through 6 devices and 5 of them have been defective.  Don't buy into the hype.<br />Turtle Beach Elite 800 for PS4 - Good features, but the max volume is not loud enough.<br />SteelSeries Wireless H - Great features, decent sound, but bass is distorted.<br />Sony MDRDS6500 - Distorted bass, surround sound is not great.<br />Sennheiser RS 195 - Great cans for movies, but no surround sound, and the enhanced sound modes are too quiet at max volume.<br />Shure SRH1540 - Amazing headphones, just not for consoles as they are wired and have no mic.<br />Sennheiser PC 363D - Hands down, best gaming headset I have ever used for PC.",2015-08-26

Why make these games all like Call of Duty? For money yes. Dumb gamers love to just shoot and hold the trigger (lancers). Great gamers love a challenge like using a Gnasher shotgun but even that was ruined. In Judgement it was a marshmallow gun. In this current installment the hit detection is awful. I guess I'll just say goodbye to my dream of a Gears of War 2 without host because they would just ruin that to. I gave over 60 days of my life in game time to Gears 2 but after this awful showing I will not be buying a Gears gane again.

I was originally turned away by the 'Copy/Paste' scandal of 2013. I now forgive them. Billion dollar deadlines can do strange things to people. In fact, after recently purchasing a used copy on a whim, I think this is the best overall game in the series. Does it have interesting characters like Captain Price? No, but Captain Price was recycled from CoD 2. Are there hackers in multiplayer? Sure, but not as many as there were in MW2. Ask yourself what you expect from the series. To me the answer is: &#34;Six hours of fast-paced bang-bang action and ridiculous set pieces in a semi-post-apocalyptic setting (or at least a really bad neighborhood, or airport), including helplessly getting knocked to the floor by a random explosion, followed by 20-1,000 multiplayer hours of getting sniped by twelve year-olds hopped up on Mountain Dew.&#34; Nowhere in that description are exo-limbs, super jumping, laser rifles, or Kevin Spacey running for his life. This may be the last Call of Duty with normal jumping. Think about that, and also realize that the Hardened Edition is only $26 and includes $50 in DLC (the codes still work).

No problem at all.<br />  Every single of my NES games works perfectly, which was a shock to me. My original NES only just recently stopped working (still the most solid game system ever built&#62;&#62; they don't make 'em like they used to!) and I went several years without playing my old vintage games. My kids had NEVER seen them! They instantly got hooked on Legend of Zelda, which thrilled me to no end, and we had to resort to thumb-wrestling to see who got to take first turn.<br />  The system works perfectly for both platforms, but as I usually do, I HAVE ONE NEGATIVE THING TO SAY<br />  The controllers that come with this system are garbage. I still gave it 5 stars because I was able to play every one of my NES games (some of which I had gotten at garage sales years before and NEVER played!) But I had the fortune of still having my SNES controllers from my original SNES (SNES controllers work both platforms on this system, so you don't have to switch out). If you don't have SNES controllers, you might find this system a disappointment. If you do, you're gonna love this thing for a long time.<br />  Thank you, Retro-Bit, for giving me my childhood back! (Even if it made me remember what a nerd I was) (was?)<br /><br />Let me know if this review helped you. Thanks! -Nater",2015-08-26

You get to choose how the story unfolds...  I picked it up yesterday and played all night! This game sticks you in a horror movie. You have the ability to control the different friends in the group, as well as really put your personality into the game by choosing what happens next. I think you will really love this if you enjoyed games like Heavy Rain or Beyond: Two Souls.The graphics are awesome, the story is so much fun, and you are in full control.  I can honestly say this is now my favorite PS4 game. The Last of Us Remastered has been bumped...  SURVIVORS: Sam, Emily, and Jessica  UPDATE: 8/28/15 I'm a woman, played this game by myself, and I live alone. BAD IDEA, lol! I was so scared to fall asleep last night after I beat the game. I would say it gave me a good 10 hours of gameplay. I started again this morning and I'm trying to make some different decisions to really test out whether or not if your choices change the outcome. I have stumbled across a few new scenes, as well as found a bunch of things I missed the first time playing. I'll write another update after I finish.  SURVIVORS: Chris, Ashley, and Emily.  FINAL CONCLUSION:  I think this is a solid game that gives a good scare. I think people misunderstood when they pitched the game as having total replay value because the story changes. The plot of the story doesn't change. However, the way the story unfolds does change. For example, Mike died early on in my game during the first time I played. The second time I made a decision that kept him alive a little longer. He ended up dying a little bit after that, but it was a totally new death. I'm assuming if he survived past that he would have another chance to die again later in the game. I understand what they meant now. Another thing I realized is that Emily is like a cockroach. You just can't kill the girl, lol    WOULD I RECOMMEND TO A FRIEND: Hell yes! I already have a friend that is borrowing it, and another 2 waiting for him to finish.",2015-08-26

I contacted Turtle Beach to see if this has the super human hearing feature and it doesn't.  It still sounds really clear.  I posted that it wasn't good for music at first, but then I looked at my computer's sound preferences and the slider was moved to the right.  When I centered it, the music quality is great.  Made me change from 4 stars to 5.  Now I love this headset even more.  For the price, design, and it being wireless. This is a good buy.  I bought the Turtle Beach stand to go along with it too.

They're like rubbery and feel flimsy, but I probably won't be using this exact controller for a fighting game anyway so its not a huge issue for me.

Mario is awesome and brings back so many memories from when I was a child. This set comes with the little black box for the games, then built-in games as well, and Super Mario 3D world, all in this $300 bundle. The console itself is not very big, sits above the Xbox One perfectly on the left side free of the vents. Has two buttons for turning on/off and then the game eject. The red little light tells you when it’s off, and stays that way until you turn it on, then is blue. The console is only compatible for the Wii U games only. Which you can find used ones at GameStop for a great price. The console isn’t very heavy at all and can be put anywhere since its so little and long. The sensor for the fun active games is just a long bar, that’s flat and sits on any surface or unit nicely, and the cord is long.<br /><br />Now the game pad that comes with it is pretty awesome, I so myself. My 5-year-old loves the game pad, you can play the games on it, instead of using the TV, so you can play on the game pad while I watch my shows. Its got volume control on it, its touch screen, the sensor goes pretty far from the console, so you can sit anywhere you want when it’s fully charged up. As long as you stay in the same room of the console it will work. When the game pad dies, plug it in, you can still play, and the cord is pretty long so you can sit comfortable.<br /><br />I got some extra pieces for the Mario Kart racing game, with the steering wheel, makes the game more fun as always, we got the Mario and Luigi remotes as well. Then Mario Party 10 as well. 10 is a ton better than the previous 8 ones. All in all this is a great bundle set, and doesn’t cost an arm and a leg. Its fun for all ages, adults and kids. They offer a wide collection of games for it, old school, and new games. The unit can be put away nicely in an entertainment set or stand perfectly for easy access. The system hooks up to WiFi, and the built-in games are kinda cheesy, but some are pretty fun. If you’re looking for a system that’s easy and fun, and not to complex this is up your alley. You can even hook up Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Instant Video on it as well.in games are kinda cheesy, but some are pretty fun.

Campaign is instant nostalgia, my only problem is that back when the game first came out the graphics were &#34;amaze-balls&#34; and today I play the remaster expecting more from the visuals, which in reality are a huge step above what they were and actually look pretty awesome.

Initially, I got this headset and within 3 days I wanted to return it because of the odd way the pass through works with wireless chat on xb1. Now I have changed my mind because I can use it for wireless 7.1 simulated DTS sound, but not chat. I changed my review to 4 stars because of this caveat. The headset does clamp down somewhat, but noise cancellation and great earpads are help that negative portion. Also, the material is loosening up after a few weeks of break-in time.  First, the look of the headset is definitely in that high end category, it's made to last. The second major thing is sound and of course the sound is incredible. I have other headsets like the g930, hyper X cloud II, px4, Sony golds, and 420x for comparison. This one has much better surround sound with the 7.1 DTS by far and of course the Bluetooth capability to listen to music or take a phone call AND hear game sound at the same time is awesome imo. The sound is also crystal clear with balance throughout the sound field. Also the bass is pretty darn good as well. The presets are many and are customizable via apps or pc downloads. There are over 16 presets set as default with the ability to customize to your liking.  The saving grace of swallowing a 300 dollar price tag is I found a way to make this headset work for my xb1, ps4, ps3, and Xbox 360 after a week and a half of finding the right toslink splitter. A toslink matrix is needed to pull this off. If anyone is interested in that, please leave a comment on this review. Needless to say I have wireless game sound on all 4 consoles and wireless chat on the xb1. I have not tested if I can use wired chat with the ps3 or ps4, but generally sound is the same on XB1 with optical out. The sound was so good that if I couldn't use the optical out then I was definitely not interested in a 300 dollar DTS headset only for one console. My main issue was that I wanted to play MGSV on PS4 and Fallout4 on XB1 and have great sound with some versatility. Having the charging base as an active pass-through into a matrix solved that for me and I love this headset now. Being able to use an android app to control everything is also pretty nifty as well, which is also the only way to adjust the mic monitoring ratio.  Now for a few negative issues I don't like, but for the sound quality I'm gonna live with. -battery life with noise cancellation active is lower than anticipated, less than 10 hours. -cannot use chat features on other consoles, but can get DTS 7.1 on PS4, X360, and PS3 once passed through a toslink matrix. -headset can hurt your ears after a few hours until broken in fully. -will need a tablet or smartphone w/bluetooth to fully adjust mic monitoring because of the supported Bluetooth app that Turtle Beach has. -some people may not go for the hidden mics because they are not as good as boom mics, but I was told that over my xb live parties that I sounded fine. Update this headset with the latest firmware from day one to avoid any issues. -the price is hard to swallow, no questions about that. -volume levels for some people may not go high enough. I factored this into the fact that it can go uncomfortable depending on the presets, games, or apps being used. For my usage it is very adequate.  Finally, I do think for all the features, great DTS sound, and presets that this is worth the asking price, at least once I got the pass-through working. There are other options available, but this thing has superior sound over pretty much anything I have used up to this point. EDIT 09/10/2015 rating down to 2 stars... I had to file a return on these due to theright ear pad coming unglued. Yes, I said unglued because you are stuck with those ear pads on the elite 800 and 800x. Its a shame because I wanted to put some HM5 replacement pads on these. This was my last run at a Turtle Beach product. Throwing down 300 dollars plus for glued ear pads is not for me. For 300 bucks, go grab a Astro Mixamp Pro and Sennheiser G4me Ones or Zeroes.",2015-08-26

It's 2015 fix the hit registration, no one wants a game where the out come is random.  The most disappointing thing about the game is the fact there's ABSOLUTELY NO SUMMARY REPORT after rounds.  So when a match ends there's no game summary report card.  You have no idea how you, your team, or the opposing team did.  This is a must have in today's online multiplayer games.

How hard is it to actually take care of your customers? We spend hundreds on a device from you, and you do everything to avoid helping your customers out. I can promise you that this will be the first, only, and last device I buy from microsoft.<br /><br />I have owned the XB1 for about 4 months.  Starting about a month ago, my controller started to not sync with my xbox.  I did all the troubleshooting MS and youtube could come up with, and it worked for a bit, but as the problem got worse and worse, I requested an exchange of the controller.  Keep in mind I have been in contact with the company since the start of the issue, within the 90 day warranty they set for all accessories that ships with the console.  They did everything to push me out past the 90 day warranty with troubleshooting that they now refuse to replace my controller.  I now have a $400 brick.  Yay me.

Here's why: (Full disclosure: not very far into the game but far enough to compare it to the PS3 version) With Borderlands: The Handsome Collection and the Shadow of Mordor, There was a noticeable difference in either gameplay (Shadow) or graphics (Borderlands), Dishonored has barely better graphics than the PS3 version and the gameplay isn't noticeably smoother either. While borderlands carried over their comic-book style graphics, they did manage to clean them up quite a bit, Dishonored didn't do that.

The graphics are phenomenal - better than anything I have seen in open world adventure games yet. The voice acting is superb, never cringeworthy and the writing is like some of the newer, better fantasy novel (think Abercrombie or Ryan). Music and effects are well chosen, and the storytelling interleaves with the more algorithmic contract missions very well. If I had to pick one attribute, I'd say that the pacing of the story telling and the way it's integrated with the progress of the game makes The Witcher III stand out compared to games like Dragon Age Inquisition.<br /><br />To reiterate my earlier warning - this game for better or worse needs you to be close to the screen - the UX is adapted for that, as are the in-game perspective and graphics.

Batman could not look any better.  His cape, suit, and the overly dramatic way he lands on the ground look great.  I felt like I was actually gliding around Gotham City.  Gotham City never looked and felt better.  You end up using detective mode for the majority of the game, but with all of the batman games it's not a big deal.  There is nothing like using detective mode and do a silent takedown of a bad guy.  Throw in the fear multitude takedown you feel like you're batman and that's a very cool thing.  I did find myself comparing this to Assigns Creed, which isn't a bad thing either.  You spend most of the time upgrading your suit, batmobile/tank weapons, and gadgets.  I found that some gadgets were'nt a big deal to upgrade.  I loved using the disruptor gun and upgrading my fear takedowns to the highest level.  I ended up having a love/hate relationship with the batmobile.  Driving the batmobile through the streets, running through anything on the streets collecting no damage to the car is a lot of fun.  Even the out of place batmobile to tank mode seemed odd for a batman game.  They were fun but also very frustrating when you had a missile lock on you constantly in the middle of a battle.  I would accidently push in the L3 a little hard in combat and the tank will go to more of a first person mode and totally create confusion.  Then throw in the riddler challenges that used the batmobile, began to become more frustrating than fun.  Then the car chases just became annoying.  But I still love the game.  My only real complaint is too much batmobile.  The control mechanics for the batmobile are totally messed up.  I shouldn't have to change the controller configuration to make the batmobile feel more comfortable.  The fighting combat is very easy to get used to and stealth is what batman is all about.  Then adding the joker, penguin, scarecrow, two-face, and other notable villians make this one a batman game explosion.  Whether you like the batmobile or not, this is a great game that sucks you into Gotham City.  With the batmobile being what it is in the game, I give the game a 4.5 out of 5.sion.

It is a very &#34;interactive&#34; game. I see other reviews comparing to telltale type games and Heavy Rain. This is absolutely true,  but in my opinion this is better on almost every level. Great graphics, great story, great characters, fantastic acting,  great horror, great game.  For the diehard survival horror fans, this game is not all that scary.

Better for solo play.,"I wanted to give this a review, as I didn't find any reviews that talked about the things I cared about. Firstly, This is a very well built headset, it has some heft, and generally it feels expensive. The fit is pretty tight. I have a pretty normal head and these are tight: I seem to be able to go about 2 hours before I need to give my ears/head a rest because of the pressure. All the controls are on the ear cups - which isn't ideal but after a few days of taking off the headset to see what button to push, you get used to it. You'll definitely need the manual to learn how to dial em in. The sound quality is VERY good- there is no doubt they are one of the best if not the best sounding gaming headphones you can buy. Plenty of bass. The noise cancelling is average at best - it doesn't compare to my bose qc25's. There is no crackling or interference at all - mine are dead silent.  The mic situation is rather unfortunate - with the firmware update people can hear you just fine, but it sounds like you are far away from the mic. Not ideal, but it isn't like you cant be heard or have to yell like some people say on here. Now my least favorite part - the mic monitoring (aka hearing your own voice amplified in your ears to compensate for having the headset on) is AWFUL. Firstly, the mic monitor level can only be adjusted via the ANDRIOD only app - by default it is set to about 80%. Secondly, the level is never loud enough- with noise cancellation off you can hear yourself okay when the game volume is low, but if you want any volume it seems like there is no monitoring at all, and you end up screaming because you can't hear yourself. But wait there is more! If you want to run noise cancelling FORGET about hearing yourself: turtle beach won't let you adjust the level with this mode on. It is almost like talking with earplugs in. This was almost enough to make me return them in itself; seriously frustrating. If you play serious multiplayer - I bet this will be your sticking point.<br /><br />The main reason I am keeping them is the sound quality and the seamless bluetooth integration. It is awesome to easily take calls or listen to spotify while you play. They sound great for music and calls work great. The charging dock rules as well.<br /><br />good: Well built, Out of this world sound, bluetooth rocks.<br /><br />bad: Mic is average, Mic monitoring is terrible.",2015-08-26

If you have ever considered buying an amiibo you should because it may hopefully change your's as well. When i first bought this i was skeptic that i may have to go and train it a lot and spend to much time on it but little did i know the full potential of the amiibo. When i woke up one morning i hear sounds of someone playing smash bros which i thought was weird until i realized that nobody was playing but yet my amiibo was fighting another cpu. Now i had not done this and neither had anyone else the amiibo had done this itself. Now i know what you must be thinking but its true the amiibo had turned on my WiiU at night and was training itself until morning so that it would be able to prove itself to me. After i played against it and sadly lost i knew that this amiibo was worthy. After beating my other amiibos i would normally set them on fire but not this one this was the chosen one. Ever since i woke up that morning my life has been different and i have kept my amiibo by my side. Once when i was walking down the street i was being mugged but luckily my amiibo came to my rescue and 1v1'd the scrub and may have even saved my life. Believe me if you have ever considered buying an amiibo you should because yours may one day save your life.,2015-08-26

Sadly, the 'dedicated servers' aren't that dedicated in this game. My review is strictly the multiplayer because the story mode, if it's like the original Gears, is amazing. My friends and I are already level 24+ on the first day of release. That's how we game. With that said, the shotgun is all over the place with consistency. Some games, I'm popping heads off with a shotgun from far, almost like a sniper. This is both good and bad. Good for me obviously but bad for the balance of the game. I should not be able to do that. Now here's the flip side. Sometimes I'm on top of a guy, as he's picking up his teammate and nothing. No hit marks, no nothing and I get instant killed. Microsoft is probably releasing this game so they can get more people excited about Gears 4 because there's no reason to re-release a classic game besides money and momentum. Sadly this is slowly becoming a shell of Halo: The Masterchief Collection - full of problems.

It took me a total of 6 hours and 23 minutes to beat the game. You can go back and replay the game for different out comes. The game has the best graphics I've seen on PS4. I thought I was playing a movie and I thought it was amazing to view. I think the game was great, but the current price is too much. I rarely replay games once I beat them. I have so many games that I need to play. I would suggest getting this from RedBox and try it out. I paid 3.00 to rent it, and beat it in one day. If you don't have a RedBox wait for the price to drop to 29.99-39.99. It was a fun game. I jumped many times in a game and I never do that. Like I said it could have been a 5 part series like Life is strange or the walking dead. However you don't have to wait months and months for the next part. Hope this review helped you all and enjoy the game. :)",2015-08-26

From the moment she lied to matt to go hug up on Mike and got jealous at Jessica she ticked me off bad. She is an absolute Witch, and you know what I really mean. I can not stand her. Her voice grates on my nerves. No one character in history has made me want to track down and punch the actor in the face like Emily. She is nagging, annoying, bossy, and witchy. Matt could have done way better than Emily.<br />The events of the past were annoying too, they were just static and the same few seconds over and over minus nearing the end.<br />The totem aspect should have been left out of the game.They were too easy to find, and you would have to constantly check them so often to remember what to look out for. The game was too huge for the totems to be used properly.<br />For me the replayability is not there.

As soon as you begin to move, it's readily apparent that there hasn't been much of an improvement at all---it's just as clunky and jerky as the original, nearly unplayable. in fact, Gears Ultimate Edition (groan) gave me one HELL of a headache after the first two levels. 30 fps? More like .003. Ray Harryhausen would have laughed his rear end off.<br />So they say the &#34;Versus&#34; Modes are at 60 fps. All right. I gave that a try, but by gosh and by darn, you can't play this game alone, in your house, by yourself, with bots as adversaries---not for love or money. You're now FORCED to wrangle a bunch of friends (none of mine were stupid enough to blow over 300 bucks on this lousy excuse for a console, so that leaves me out), or sadly and pathetically join a bunch of fifteen (or less) year old strangers on one of the Coalition's precious servers. No bots! No Horde Mode! None of the satisfaction that comes from beating the computer's brains out!<br />  I realize not much of the last paragraph will mean anything to the average gamer, their only source of meaningful social contact being electronic gizmos and do-dads. I'm still of the old school---video games are things I do on my own when it's late, and I'm too lazy to do the things I ought to be doing. This ain't one of those types of games. I thought Gears 3 had some issues with the campaign, but at least you could see what was going on, the enemy died when you shot them, and Horde and Team Deathmatch could be played pretty much under any circumstances. I played in the Beta for GOWUE, and I had a feeling it would be like this. I sure wish I'd found a way to borrow one first. I'm ready to throw my Xbox One out with the morning rubbish.

Once the controller is on you are good to go and it starts charging. The fan seems to be working and the PS4 internal fan doesn't seem to come on as much anymore while the stand fan is on.

I personally loved sonic before this game, but this game made me love it more.  Its not like the original Sonic games on Nintendo and such but it is very fun and enjoyable.  Story mode is enough to keep you busy and interesting enough to keep playing.  You play the Hero side (sonic, tails...) or you play the Dark side (shadow, eggman...) and even after you finished both stories, there are still lots of add one and things to try to unlock and some are so difficult it gets frustrating, but I enjoyed trying.  My favorite part about this game was Chao world.  Chaos are super adorable creatures that are like babies that grow and you take care of.  You power them up, evolve, race, do karate matches, and more.  If you have two different memory cards and have a sibling who enjoys the game as much , I suggest separate accounts on different memory cards.  That way both players can train and have competitions against one another with their chaos.  Not to mention reaching &#34;immortality&#34; is time consuming but it's worth it to have that neat looking immortality chao in your garden. Even now, when I'm older, I still enjoy it when I have time.<br /><br />Over all there's a lot to do in this game as 1 player, but I feel like they could have done more for 2 players.<br /><br />Games i personally recommend for those who have GameCube would be:<br />Sonic Adventure 2 battle<br />Super Smash Brother Melee<br />Zelda games (i got the Legend of Zelda collectors edition that includes ocarina of time, majoras mask, adventure of link, and legend of zelda)<br />Mario party<br />Mario Kart Double Dash<br />Kirby Air ride (unexpectedly fun with someone else to play with)<br />Luigi's mansion",2015-08-26

Then pressed the &#34;connect&#34; button on the receiver, which then started blinking green. Then I pressed the &#34;connect&#34; button on my controller, which is the small button between the right and left shoulder buttons on top of the controller. Then a few seconds later the top left LED on the Xbox controller X lit up and I knew I was connected. I had a little prompt on my PC about automatically installing the drivers for the controller, then it was done.

Keeps controllers charged and system cool. Great quality!,This console stand and charger is exactly what I needed to keep my entertainment system area tidy and clutter free and our PS4 running at optimal performance. The cooling fans are not any louder than the one I have for my laptop and do a great job at keeping my system from getting hot. It's super convenient for having the controllers right where we can find them on the charge station. The blue leds look nice and the stand itself is heavy and durable for being plastic. The price on this is AMAZING considering how well it's working!! I've been using mine about a week and I don't know how I lasted without it. I do wish the ps4 day tighter in the stand but it's not a big deal around my house. I received my stand free or at a promotional price for testing and evaluation purposes but my review is solely based on my experience and honest opinions after using this with my own ps4. I'm so super pleased with this stand!,2015-08-26

But, if you want a 'Ton of Games' at your finger tips with not enough room to hold them all on your current hard drive; get the DB and 4tb or higher. I got the 4tb on sale get deal.<br /><br />I just Beat Bloodborne, and I really wished I bought it on my HD because I hate switching disc. What had happen two weeks ago was I went to Play a game from a disc and it was the first time I played one from my DB. Keep giving me this Stupid Error Code about your disc drive doesn't work. So the safest bet on the PS4 is to Boot the system up in Safemode, then Reinitialize; 90% of the time its the right call, and its almost 50% of the time when you call PS4 support they'll ask you do this if the problem is that difficult regardless of the problem.<br /><br />It fix the problem, to my only other problem is I can't use Sleepmode. In standby for too long the console shuts off and and acts like there was a power outage; just play it safe and save a few bucks. Shut the console off completely and always take off that Auto Turn-off feature, I was at a point in FFXIV where I had to do a few things that took longer than I hoped and it shut off, nothing was wrong but the whole you disconnected the power  or whatever BS showed up and. It just scares me when I get that message. That reminds me of my days with Poke'mon where your save file was gone and you had to start over. I love'd my 47 out of 152  at level 99 game. FYI, (SMH) my goal was to get all 152 Poke'mon to 99.<br /><br />P.S. Still a great buy",2015-08-26

The story and music helped a lot. There were some good battles and bosses but I found it pretty linear. Being a Bioshock fan, I craved more of an open world. There were a few side missions and puzzles but beyond that it was a very linear plan. I don't recall being as emotionally attached to characters or situations on other games as this. I found myself having moments that made the linear part disappear and make this more of an experience.<br />I gave it 4 stars because of that. Also smooth gameplay and good graphics. The weapon wheel was just a bit annoying at times. But overall, good game.",2015-08-26

UPDATE!,"UPDATE: The problem with this battery not holding a charge seems to have a lot to do with how you charge it. Simply charging it from the PS3 wasn't enough, it seems. Not sure if it was a voltage or amperage problem, but either way, here's how mine came back to life. I plugged into a battery pack [[ASIN:B00QOEVMPS Tzumi Pocket Juice 2200 Mah USB Recharge]] so I wouldn't be tied to the console. I noticed a few days later that the battery pack was off (does this automatically), but the controller was still on. It's been unplugged for several days now, and it's all good. Played several hours yesterday with vibe on and it's still on. If your battery has &#34;died&#34;, save your cash for later and hook up to something like a tablet charger or external battery pack.<br /><br />Original review:<br />Almost lasted a year (bought it 9 Aug 14). Was great for a while, then needed to be charged constantly. A month or two ago it died completely. It is WAY cheaper than buying another controller, so as unthrilled as I am to be replacing it already, at least it was cheap. I will be trying another brand, but I honestly expect the same result. Again, still much cheaper than the whole shebang.",2015-08-26

I am a huge gamer and I've been using the xbox 360 core ever since it came out back in 06. Microsoft has always done amazing with their consoles and I am looking foward to seeing what is next! Here is the 1 downside of it: I have the 500gb console and I can tell that it WILL run out of internal storage. You can't remove the hard drive like in the 360s, so that is one of the only dissapointments I had with the console. Most games take up about 20-50 gb and if you just get the downloaded games, you WILL run out of space..... But hey, if you want all the space, just get the 1tb console and it will last a lot longer. I am pleased and happy with this console and I expect to get the most out of it while I'm into gaming!

US,47470194,R3D63G8TCUI27K,B00W435BU0,487294121,Madden NFL 16,Video Games,5,10,24,N,N,"Yeah, I love it.","I'm baffled why so many supposed fans of this game come in here and give it a bad review. Have you really played it or just have an agenda against Madden? In either case... Madden took years to come to form. I admit there has been some rough releases over the years.  I've played it since it's first arrival on the beloved Sega Genesis and look what we got now?  It's had a rocky road here and there, and  I understand it's been under heat for being too much like the previous years game, but no worries, they give you just enough to make it feel new.<br /><br />Madden 16 is the first game to utilize penalties to their potential. We finally have them and they work! Pass interference calls? Yep sure are. Holding? Yep. Defensive holding? Sure thing. Late hits penalty calls? You bet!  This makes the game feel more like a real game.  I haven't decided if they're over done yet, but so far, it's pretty standard on what you see in a real game.  It really adds to the realism if you're into the more simulation aspects. It still has the classic controls of Madden.  Truck stick, hit stick, spin move, hurdle, juke, etc.... Long time madden fans will be right at home with it. The newest things are the aggressive catch and possession catch functions. The aggressive catch can make for a amazing eye candy that you have never seen in a football game before, it's so real people walking into the room are thinking they're seeing ESPN highlights. With aggressive catch activated with &#34;triangle&#34; on the PS4, you can make for some spectacular catches and they look spectacular on both sides of the ball. Defensive will also make some amazing attempts to gain possession. Defense can do the same thing, so it's kind of a crapshoot what happens depending if they go up for the aggressive catch. You can make some mistakes if you get hit using the aggressive too much and interceptions can be more gracious. I do like the new function, but as with anything, including the penalties, if you don't like them, turn them off.<br /><br />The game feel more organic than ever. 15 was great IMO already. Sure, you get the occasional times where guys flop around on piles and play possum on the field till they want to get up. Yeah, I understand it looks silly, but does it really interfere with the game itself?  A lot of review sites already say this is unacceptable. I say, it's no big deal. When the game is in play, that's what counts.<br /><br />The game has a fantastic running game. Blockers seem to make holes and are smarter around running down the field with you. The classic truck stick is still there, although I dont think it's as powerful as it once was as a veteran Madden player will probably agree. 16 has a ton of new animations to make the game feel more awesome. There's some brutal hits going on in this game. Although I've probably put in 10 hours already, I haven't had any injuries? hmmmm.<br /><br />Passing feels good. I actually prefer to play on the game speed on &#34;very slow&#34;. I think normal or even slow is too much speed for me, but that's just a preference.  QB's with lower ratings finally are making more incomplete passes and they are definitely inconsistent! That's good! I noticed in 15, QB's with bad ratings were sometimes going 25 for 27 in one game! Now if your QB is just a bench guy or not very good in general, you'll see a lot of short and overthrown passes. This is a good thing again if you're playing a team with strong running game, but a passing game, not so much. QB's seem to get more rattled. As mentioned above, you're going to see some great one on one battles with the new &#34;aggressive&#34; catch option.  IF you want to play things safe, you can go for the regular catch or possession. Going for strictly possession, you lose the ability to get yards after a catch. Some people like to just let the cpu do all the work, that's fine, but you lose your ability to make big plays. That's the rules with madden for years, if you take over, youhave a better chance at making something big happen!<br /><br />Defensively is still fun with the &#34;behind the back perspective&#34; Sometimes I feel like the camera does some funky things after a pass, but I can usually play good defense sticking with this angle. The hit stick, while still there, doesn't seem as intense as past years? (Is this the NFL saying tone is down EA?) I sure hope not. Either way, it's good we still have the ability to make a big hit to cause those fumbles!<br /><br />Presentation is better than last year, but it's not light years better. Some new commentary lines here and there, a bit more details, but they still sound like they're reading too much. Not horribly bad, but needs a rehaul for next year.<br /><br />The graphics are stunning. The players faces got the most love, you'll see that in the intro. Very detailed stadiums, amazing use of lighting and shadows and spot on reflections on the helmets.  Some of the cut scenes they show in between plays etc are a bit over done, but hey, if you like presenation, there ya go!<br /><br />The classic and most beloved mode is back, the Ultimate Team mode. Build your team of scrubs into the ultimate Madden team and take them online!<br /><br />Speaking of online, I haven't had any major issues, EA has always had decent servers. I've only noticed a few games with a little input lag, but it's very good considering how many people were playing at once.<br /><br />Madden 16 is a great game. Anyone new to the series should pick it up. I don't know if I can justify 60 bucks if you have 15, but if you're a Madden fan like I am, I already know that you probably already have it.

It Earned the Title Golden.,"This was the one game that my friend would give a ten out of ten and it's one of five for me. Alongside Tales of Vesperia, Majora's Mask, Virtues Last Reward and Devil May Cry 3, this is one of the best games of all time. The story is immersive, the characters fun and the gameplay is the best turn-based combat there is, with the use of 1more attacks by exploiting weaknesses and random aid, like cavalry attacks and team ups. The social link system is unique, adding a purpose to interacting with the diverse and interesting side characters. If I had one criticism, it's that there is no point to aim for any ending but the Golden ending, but that's because the Golden ending is so good and most of the other endings are basically game overs with a conclusion to the story. If you like JRPGs, you already own this game. If you're wondering if this is worth buying a Vita or PSTV for, I'd say there is no better RPG on the system and definitely should lean you towards buying it.",2015-08-25

The area they have best excelled in is gameplay, and it has come a LONG way since it's current gen debut.<br /><br />The great part of the gameplay comes with a new wrinkle of the WR/DB interactions.  It feels like there is a true jostling between the two players with true results.  Not only do you get true results, but the animations and look and feel are fresh with every pass attempt.  Speaking of the pass attempts, you can do a lot with QB to get it to the WR in the best possible way from holding down the button for a bullet pass, double tapping the button for a touch pass, or tapping the button once for a lob.  You can modify using L1 or LB for a high pass and L2 or LT for a low pass, and once you get the hang of these mechanics, you can start doing them without thinking about it when the situation arises.<br /><br />While it is disappointing that CFM is pretty much unchanged, and still isn't as engaging online as the Online Dynasty was in NCAA Football.  There are still some great additions, including a long time commish wishlist item, choosing the winner for simulated games.  I also really like the dynamic drive goals.  Much like the dynamic goals in NBA 2K's MyPlayer mode, it gives a level of immersion and changes it up for you instead of just sticking to your same ol' gameplan.  It makes you change things up, but really doesn't penalize you if you choose not to accept the mission.  I also like the running tally of game, season, and career goals for the players showing at the bottom after a play as well.  Those are some welcome tweaks.<br /><br />The biggest new mode of Madden 16 is Draft Champions, and it is fun as hell.  First you choose your coach that will give you style boost for one offensive and one defensive group, then you draft 15 players to mold your team.  You'll be shown three players and you have to choose one.  The great thing about this is when you highlight the player, it also highlights your current depth chart below so you don't draft two studs at the same position.  That is very slick.  I could have done without Adam Schefter's commentary after picks though.  The players that come up will be a balance between gold and elite Ultimate Team players with the 15th and final round drafting a legend.  You'll then try to win three games to be the Draft Champion either solo or online with friends.  I think it's a great way to play Madden for some competition with friends on a random night.<br /><br />Speaking of Ultimate Team, it is back with a very sharp new logo and a bunch of new content as well.  There are well over 150 solo challenges to do in the new Journey; which are full of scenarios and not just full games to beat.  Not only is it something new to try to beat with your Ultimate Team, but it is a great way to get your team started as well because each challenge gives you coins and sometimes packs to help build your team without having to break the bank early on buying packs.<br /><br />And finally, I'm not going to give any spoilers, but the opening playable scene is AMAZING and props to those who had a hand in creating it.<br /><br />Overall, Madden 16 is VERY close to achieving their ultimate goals, and if they work on Connected Franchise next year with what the community wants to see, they will reach those goals.",2015-08-25

They have been both a hit and absolutely a miss. Most racing games for the Nintendo 3DS have been both a hit and a miss. The most successful is been Mario Kart 7, which has delivered stunning graphics, and excellent gameplay. The least favorite racing game has been a Hot Wheels game, that has been more about effects, and not gameplay. But seeing a popular app become a Nintendo 3DS game, is really a big challenge. Garfield Kart has been a very successful app to download to the tablets and the smartphone. But being available to the Nintendo 3DS, well making that deliver just as strong is really a challenge. Garfield has been so popular as a cartoon and a comic strip for over 30 years. But the question is does it really deliver for the 3DS.<br /><br />Garfield Kart for the Nintendo 3DS, is one of those that looks like fun, but overall needs a lot of work that really can deliver as a more serious game. Loosely based on the characters from the Garfield Show from 2007-2009 on Cartoon Network and Boomerang, you can play your favorites from Garfield, Odie, John Arbuckle and others through 16 different tracks and 3 speed levels. Graphically, the game looks good and has the classic music from The Garfield Show very nicely. Sadly, what makes the game loose its shine is mainly the control. The controls are too loose, and you honestly are going to spend a little more time spinning out, and not making it to the checkered flag in first place. Sadly, it does cause the game to loose the fun overall. The game does have a lot of spin, but honestly a little too much to where it might not be fun.<br /><br />All in all, Garfield Kart does mostly have what I would want in a racing game, except that there could have been much tighter control, to make it more fun to play. I still enjoy Garfield, but I could not believe that there could have been much better overall. It is a lovely racing game, but sadly, the most important part of a video game, is really addictive fun. I was interested in it, and sadly I really lost a bit of fun afterwards. I do hope that if there is going to be a better follow-up to try and definitely step it up on the lasanga loving fun. The game is a good title for huge Garfield fans, but not for the long-term video game racer.<br /><br />Graphics: B<br /><br />Sound: B<br /><br />Control: C-<br /><br />Fun & Enjoyment: C<br /><br />Overall: C 1/2+a video game, is really addictive fun.

First of all, I usually go with ps4 games, but I couldn't resist having the ability to play it for 10 horus before release with EA access. EA access basically lets' you play games early, which is a good thing. And I have to say I'm very pleased with the XBONE Version of Madden.<br /><br />Madden took years to come to form. I've played it since it's first arrival on the beloved Sega Genesis and look what we got now?  It's had a rocky road here and there, and  I understand it's been under heat for being too much like the previous years game, but no worries, they give you just enough to make it feel new.<br /><br />Madden 16 is the first game to utilize penalties to their potential. We finally have them and they work! Pass interference calls? Yep sure are. Holding? Yep. Defensive holding? Sure thing. Late hits penalty calls? You bet!  This makes the game feel more like a real game.  I haven't decided if they're over done yet, but so far, it's pretty standard on what you see in a real game.  It really adds to the realism if you're into the more simulation aspects. It still has the classic controls of Madden.  Truck stick, hit stick, spin move, hurdle, juke, etc.... Long time madden fans will be right at home with it. The newest things are the aggressive catch and possession catch functions. The aggressive catch can make for a amazing eye candy that you have never seen in a football game before, it's so real people walking into the room are thinking they're seeing ESPN highlights. With aggressive catch activated with *Y* on the XBONE you can make for some spectacular catches and they look spectacular on both sides of the ball. Defensive will also make some amazing attempts to gain possession. Defense can do the same thing, so it's kind of a crapshoot what happens depending if they go up for the aggressive catch. You can make some mistakesif you get hit using the aggressive too much and interceptions can be more gracious. I do like the new function, but as with anything, including the penalties, if you don't like them, turn them off.<br /><br />The game feel more organic than ever. 15 was great IMO already. Sure, you get the occasional times where guys flop around on piles and play possum on the field till they want to get up. Yeah, I understand it looks silly, but does it really interfere with the game itself?  A lot of review sites already say this is unacceptable. I say, it's no big deal. When the game is in play, that's what counts.<br /><br />The game has a fantastic running game. Blockers seem to make holes and are smarter around running down the field with you. The classic truck stick is still there, although I dont think it's as powerful as it once was as a veteran Madden player will probably agree. 16 has a ton of new animations to make the game feel more awesome. There's some brutal hits going on in this game. Although I've probably put in 10 hours already, I haven't had any injuries? hmmmm.<br /><br />Passing feels good. I actually prefer to play on the game speed on &#34;very slow&#34;. I think normal or even slow is too much speed for me, but that's just a preference.  QB's with lower ratings finally are making more incomplete passes and they are definitely inconsistent! That's good! I noticed in 15, QB's with bad ratings were sometimes going 25 for 27 in one game! Now if your QB is just a bench guy or not very good in general, you'll see a lot of short and overthrown passes. This is a good thing again if you're playing a team with strong running game, but a passing game, not so much. QB's seem to get more rattled. As mentioned above, you're going to see some great one on one battles with the new &#34;aggressive&#34; catch option.  IF you want to play things safe, you can go for the regular catch or possession. Going for strictly possession, you lose the ability to get yards after a catch. Some people like to just let the cpudo all the work, that's fine, but you lose your ability to make big plays. That's the rules with madden for years, if you take over, you have a better chance at making something big happen!<br /><br />Defensively is still fun with the &#34;behind the back perspective&#34; Sometimes I feel like the camera does some funky things after a pass, but I can usually play good defense sticking with this angle. The hit stick, while still there, doesn't seem as intense as past years? (Is this the NFL saying tone is down EA?) I sure hope not. Either way, it's good we still have the ability to make a big hit to cause those fumbles!<br /><br />Presentation is better than last year, but it's not light years better. Some new commentary lines here and there, a bit more details, but they still sound like they're reading too much. Not horribly bad, but needs a rehaul for next year.<br /><br />The graphics are stunning. The players faces got the most love, you'll see that in the intro. Very detailed stadiums, amazing use of lighting and shadows and spot on reflections on the helmets.  Some of the cut scenes they show in between plays etc are a bit over done, but hey, if you like presenation, there ya go!<br /><br />The classic and most beloved mode is back, the Ultimate Team mode. Build your team of scrubs into the ultimate Madden team and take them online!<br /><br />Speaking of online, I haven't had any major issues, EA has always had decent servers. I've only noticed a few games with a little input lag, but it's very good considering how many people were playing at once.<br /><br />Madden 16 is a great game. Anyone new to the series should pick it up. I don't know if I can justify 60 bucks if you have 15, but if you're a Madden fan like I am, I already know that you probably already have it.

I believe this game originally launched 3 years ago overseas. You can see this a little when playing this game, but it has the anime feel and is very polished so you won't notice it too much. I actually didn't hear about this game until about a week before release. It seemed cool so i bought it. Being a 26 yr old guy, i was kinda worried because the stuff i was reading was intending it for kids, but anyways here is my review:<br /><br />I've got 4 hours in so far and am on the beginning of episode 3 (no clue how many they are). So far I am really enjoying my experience, from first getting my LBX to stopping an assassination on a public figure using an LBX. The battles last about 1 minute each average with boss battles taking about double for the cut scenes in the middle of a battle. Customization is so huge i am still trying to learn what all i can do to my LBX. Any change you do to your LBX, Does make a difference in a fight.<br /><br />Customization: You can change armor, CPU, Battery, Weapon, etc. there is different armors of course, some will offer big defense but slow you down (Dozer Armor) but some will offer light armor and faster movement (Amazon Armor). Weapons are also each unique, i prefer lances, but always keep a gun handy for longer range.<br /><br />Battles: In the battles at first your 1vs1 but through the story you will be teamed up for 3vs3 battles. The other 2 people on your team will vary but so far its your character's (Van) friends. They are different landscapes that you play on, however most of the time the area will be familiar. The areas are not always flat either, some have multi levels. The Friendly AI will sometimes die easily but most of the time they weaken them for me to finish off which is perfectly fine for me!<br /><br />Overall I like this game, but one thing that worries me is the replay value after the story. there is noonline multiplayer, only local. However if i look at Pokemon, it also just has a story. So i guess i will see when that point comes. If you like Pokemon, Anime, Robots, then you will probably enjoy this game.<br /><br />Thanks for reading and hope i helped someone!",2015-08-25

US,8489911,R1MNDXAP2J5ELS,B0050SXAIG,443852357,Silent Hill HD Collection,Video Games,2,2,2,N,N,The greatest and most disturbing horror game of all time suffers a tragic medicore transfer.,"If you ask me, Silent Hill 2 is the greatest game ever made. Hell, it is one of the greatest pieces of literary works ever made. I wasn't a fan of the Silent Hill series. I just thought they were typical horror games, and due to the fact I only really heard about Shattered Memories, who could blame me? Then I heard Fermata in Mystic Air. It was disturbing, it was haunting. It was unlike anything I ever heard. But I did not get the game, nor did I pay attention to it. Fast forward many years. A week ago, I because obsessed with the second game. So I decided to buy a few more tracks. I was drawn into it simply for it's utterly astonishing soundtrack by the superb Akira Yamaoka. It stunned me with it's haunting beauty, melancholic sadness, and unnerving sounds, to where I asked myself, &#34;How can a video game have a soundtrack of this quality?&#34; and read up a lot of it. I fell in love with the very heavy and unsettling subject matter and deep psychological manipulation. The perfect usage of sound, sight, story, and imagery in a video game. This was a truly disturbing and twisted work of art that I needed to experience.  Now, I heard about the HD Collection, and was excited. Affording a PS2, plus the original game was out of the question, unless I bought them used on Amazon. However, the staggering amount of negative reviews keep turning me off, and I was totally torn. I didn't know how to feel because I truly did want this game. I needed to experience it.  I broke down. I bought the Silent Hill HD Collection. I couldn't help it. I started Silent Hill 2, and it was disturbing me right away. It manipulated your mind. The weird indescribable noise while you're running. It was so hard to see. The opening was so sad, and so beautiful. It draws you into this beautifully tragic experience right from the beginning. However, I began to see why exactly this was hated, by my own accounts and comparisons to the original.  I played for what amounted to 10 minutes. I caught onespelling error so far, and cutscenes were strange. When you meet Angela at the graveyard, it's fullscreen and has a blurred effect, as well as brightness, and once it ended, the game went back to it's... I guess &#34;widescreen,&#34; and washed out look and it felt a bit jarring. I'm not sure if this was in the PS2 version. The fog was incredibly blinding, and yes, more dense, however, you could still faintly see a sort of &#34;line,&#34; but it's not too noticeable, at first, anyway. It is more accentuated on the road to Silent Hill. It bothered me, and I noticed some fog surrounding James sort of &#34;stutters,&#34; or &#34;clips.&#34; Exiting a menu is a bit delayed, with the black screen not catching up with it, so yeah, the game continues for a bit before you can see whatever the hell is going on, which made me disoriented and took damage from a nearby enemy before the screen could fade. Due to repeated listening to the music, unfortunately, yes, Akira Yamaoka's beautiful score had been tampered with. To be fair, the new patch did fix the game a bit, which is why I'm giving this two stars. I never checked out Silent Hill 3, or progressed enough to really see more flaws.  I just returned this today, and I will buy a PS2 along with the original version. It's not too expensive, actually. Still, I needed to see the collection for myself. It's not horrible, yet, but yes, pretty frustrating and technically flawed, not to mention jarring, even for someone who hasn't played the original. I agree that this was unacceptable. In fact, it's agonizingly unacceptable. I have NEVER played the original and already I feel the pain of the most horrific game ever made being butchered in a thoughtless transfer.  But, there might be hope. The planned Silent Hills was cancelled, which was tragic as well... but I also heard one of the original developers or artists of I think Team Silent would be working on it. I might be stretching it, and it might be a delusional thought, but whatif the cancellation was a good thing? Could they be possibly, possibly working on porting it again? I mean porting the original second to PSN, or even another attempt at a remaster and actually working from the finished source code? We can hope, we can always hope.",2015-08-25

If you played either of the first two or the original for the PS3, it's the same game with major to slightly different stories. I say that as a complement. The series is great for JRPGs and well justified my purchase of the Vita once I was done with the Persona games.<br /><br />This game has one, okay two, big problems though. The minor one I barely want to mention if the lack of an EXE gauge, which is annoying since now SP is used for all skills. The major one, though, is Iris Heart. She is a straight up sadist and molests multiple characters throughout the game. I'm not going to sugar coat it. It's uncomfortable and the game suffers for it. It's a shame too, considering her normal for, Plutia, is such a good complement to the rest of the cast and makes sense as the person to become Planeptune's CPU in an alternate dimension.<br /><br />This game is everything I wanted to be and a little more than I wanted when it came to Iris Heart, but it is on par, if not better than Re;Birth 2. The first is still the best, but none of the games are flat-out bad. The spin offs however, have many problems, so make sure you read reviews on those separately.

This means you could shot someone with a boomshot or throw a grenade at their feet and they make it out alive. gears of war 1 was a great game but had audio issues and sometimes choppy moments but here its full 60 fps awesome glory. Its the same game with a other multiplayer modes you'd seen from Gears of war 3 for an example. If you like Gears of war(series) and tired of playing it on on the xbox 360 then try it here. It looks so much better.<br /><br />this is also my what I was told for contacting Amazon regarding my Pre-order<br /><br />Adam, I'm forwarding your concern to our games specialized team.

Here is why...<br /><br />Durability<br /><br />The two black columns with the green wires inside are made of metal. The rest of the headset is hard plastic. The structure of these things are insanely well put together. Worth 300$ if you go off of that. The ear cups have some sort of memory foam which is really breathable for your ears.<br /><br />Comfort<br /><br />The A50's are highly comfortable and easily adjusted by pushing up on the black column and down to move them down of course. Again, he ear cups have some sort of memory foam which is really breathable for your ears and is really comfortable to wear.<br /><br />Set-up<br /><br />Now setting these things up is super easy! 3 Cables: Digital in and out cable, power cable, and charging cable. That's it! Super easy and fast set up! Now these are NOT COMPLETELY WIRELESS if you wanna use xbox live chat. You still need to put the chat able in the controller along in the headset themselves.<br /><br />Connectivity<br /><br />Okay, this is the reason why i returned mine! The first hour or so the headsets were working fine. No buzzing or anything. Perfectly fine! Then out of nowhere my controller starts losing power which in turn causes the controller to constantly disconnect. There was no solution or anything so I returned my headset and went with the Turtle Beach 800X, but thats for another review that I will be writing soon!<br /><br />All in all these headsets are perfect, if you do not want to chat, and just do hardcore gaming!",2015-08-25

I gather that prior to the advent of XBox One, it was only available &#34;out of region.&#34;  At any rate, the things that appealed to me about Sniper Elite were the opportunities to deliberate, plan, and execute.  Lots of stealth, taking on challenges sensibly, in a reasoned order, more or less at my own pace, and being rewarded for such deliberation and care.  If that's what you liked about this company's products, throw your expectations out the window.  Zombie Army is basically a twitch fest, where the &#34;game&#34; rapidly becomes surviving hordes of enemies thrown at you incessantly.  There is zero opportunity for deliberation or strategy.  You might as well go play Call of Duty or Halo, since there's no functional difference.  Fans of stealth, deliberation, strategy and care:  stay away.",2015-08-25

At the same time there are so many options when it comes to a certain niche market products that it’s often so hard for a buyer to find the best bang for the buck. This is much the mind-set I went out with when I went out looking for a wireless headset.<br /><br />My shortlist ironically turned out to be quite long and I was faced with what I’d like to call the BBB dilemma (Best Bang for Buck). BTW ,with me this feeling can get quiet chronic with and it often leaves me procrastinating and can even escalate to full withdrawal from my intention to buy.<br /><br />Upgrading from: Logitech G330, a really nice headset, good value. After about 1 year of use it  developed a known issue with one of the speakers where it would stop working or distort when the cable is twisted in a certain position. I would imagine that this was fixed on later versions or that Logitech offered some form of compensations for this with other customers, but I've never really had a chance to notify Logitech (more on this later).<br /><br />Reasons for the upgrade:<br />To fuel my complicated lifestyle I spend lots of time gaming of which a lot goes into playing a game called EVE Online which by choice often involves long (sometimes uninterrupted) PVP sessions of up to 3 hours. I get off my chair during gameplay to grab something in the kitchen, deal with dogs or give attention to my wife but at the same time to avoid a galactic ingame catastrophe I need to stay on comms with my teammates. A wireless headset would be the perfect solution to keep the volatile EVE universe in balance. ;-p<br /><br />I’ve put together a list of requirements and an overflow of nice to haves that I ended up with.<br /><br />Requirements:<br />•Wireless Range - range to extend reasonably in the area of kitchen (7 meters/23 feet) or living room (6 meters/20 feet) each divided by one wall.<br />•Wireless Rechargeable - to be able to recharge while using if battery runs out.<br />•Wireless Battery Life - use up to 3 hours before recharge is required<br />•PC Compatible<br />•Good Sound Quality (including speakers and microphone)<br />•Comfort - comfy fit for up to 4 hours of gaming<br />•Build Quality - One of my earlier headsets, the Cyber Snipa SONAR 5.1 was a great headset with awesome sound, especially the bass quality was superb but, one of the hinges where the earcups attached broke off within less than 8 months of general use. I need something that can perhaps endure some short periods of rage and occasional outbursts of frustration during gaming; ok, I may be exaggerating, but you get the idea.<br /><br />Nice to Have:<br />• Price tag $100 or less<br />• Multi-platform compatibility with Playstation 3 and/or Xbox<br />• Surround sound<br />• Removable Microphone<br /><br />Given my requirements and generally high expectations it was a fair challenge to find what I was looking for. After lots of research, procrastination and several withdrawals while deciding on a headset, our cute little puppy ate the earcups off the Logitech G330; you can guess what happened next.<br /><br />So, did the Gioteck EX-06 meet my requirements and expectations? Well, let’s look at the list.<br /><br />Wireless Range – 8/10 It reaches the kitchen and living room on most occasions but understandably if I open the fridge with my head halfway in to grab another brew, the signal distorts.<br /><br />Wireless Rechargeable – 10/10 It met my requirement perfectly, the only thing I can fault was the length of the cable but with a USB hub built into my keyboard I’m able to get close enough to use the headset while it’s charging. The cable is a standard micro USB cable so if I ever really needed to I can go purchase a longer cable from the local electronic shop.<br /><br />Wireless Battery Life 9/10 - The battery life is really good, it exceeded my needs. I’ve been using it for about 11 months with average daily use up to 6 hours, the lifespan of the battery seems reasonable thus far. I get about 4-5 hours of use from a single charge; from what I’ve observed the wireless life hasn’t diminished since the day I received it. The only reason I’m giving a 9/10 is because I can’t really score on it just yet as I haven’t used the product long enough to provide an honest opinion on the battery life, and from what I know it cannot be replaced if it’s at the end of it’s life.<br /><br />PC Compatible 10/10 - I use it on windows and haven’t had any trouble with drivers or setup. I’ve played a few games like Battlefield 3, Total War: Rome II, GTA V and EVE Online and haven’t come across any compatibility issues yet.<br /><br />Good Sound Quality 9/10 - I can’t fault the sound quality from requirements perspective, the bass is really good and the overall quality is actually quite impressive for a headset within this price range so I’d say it’s great value for money. Some ability to fine tune would be nice. One thing I’ve noticed when using it on surround mode is that the bass is not as well tuned as with normal stereo mode.<br />I’ve recorded myself with the microphone and overall, the replay sounds good, it’s not wow but with what the general gamer uses it for you don’t need more than what it offers. I’ve never heard any complaints from my team mates that they couldn’t hear me or anything like that, in fact I’ve only received compliments on the quality when I asked what the clarity was like on the receiving end.<br /><br />Comfort 7/10 - Due to the rigid build quality it doesn’t fit as snug as most headsets I’ve tried in the past however it is a remarkably better than the Logitech G330 which I used.<br /><br />Build quality 10/10 - The build quality on this thing is absolutely unheard of. Every component looks and feels firm, and this was one of the biggest selling points when I decided on a headset. I don’t think many tech products come from the UK but this one really echoes what other British brands offer consumers.<br /><br />Overall Verdict 9/10 - I am very happy with this product, I can’t speak for the other options as I haven’t tried them yet but for me, this was the best bang for my buck. It’s not perfect but with everything you buy there will be trade-offs you will need to make like, with comfort there will almost always be some compromise on build quality and/or price. Eventually you just have to find the right balance in your list of requirements.lly needed to I can go purchase a longer cable from the local electronic shop.<br /><br />Wireless Battery Life 9/10 - The battery life is really good, it exceeded my needs.

I feel I just don't like to dance the male dance routine's as much since I relate more to the female dancer as that is what I am. also I have noticed that in one dance song I can't recall the name of it at the moment it seem's the dance and song are a bit off sync (both the wii and ps3 versions have this on the same routine).  It has many songs/routines to choose from, you can dance to single song's or choose to do 20min, 45 min or more of dance pileups for a full workout. I also saw there is a dance party section where you can dance and compete with other people who own the ps3 version of Zumba party also but there never seems to be anyone on there to compete with so I just stopped clicking on that.

My Game of the Year For 2015.","Chilling, well acted and with a lot of jump scares. It's just like watching a scary '80s-'90s horror movie (very much an homage to classics such as Scream, The Descent, Saw, or The Cabin In The Woods), but you control the action, and this &quot;movie&quot; is over 8 hours long. Although the game mechanics are very different, in terms of theme, quality, and how each playthrough can result in different characters surviving, it's similar to the classic Xbox 360 game &quot;Left 4 Dead&quot;.<br /><br />The first few minutes really gets you emotionally involved in the plot, and while the plot setup is a bit forced, it works in terms of the scary movie genre that the game is paying homage to. The introduction is slow-paced (not for those with a short attention span), but for the rest of us, the tension starts right away, and it does not let up for a moment. The game really gets the atmosphere right. Also, you care for each character, and while it's true that some of them are not wholly likeable (in horror movie tradition, some are immature and they can be unkind, self-centered or unthinking), you really feel as if you want to get them all through the horror that is about to overtake them.<br /><br />The game controls are simple, intuitive and effective, and movement is smooth. The graphics are amazing, from the facial textures to the snowfall, lighting and shadows, this game really takes advantage of this latest generation of consoles to bring out detail and atmosphere. Music is very atmospheric and extremely well integrated into the action. The clues and collectibles in the game are very effective, and the in-game menus work well to help the player assess how well he is doing. During the action sequences, the player needs to make split-second decisions and controller inputs, and in my opinion (speaking as an older but experienced gamer) these are perfectly balanced to appeal to players of most abilities.<br /><br />Replay value is wholly focused on survival, not on a branching plot. This is not a bad thing: while the overarching plot remains fixed, the fate of each character is very much decided by your actions and choices: any character or all of them can die. Conversely, any or all can be saved, but saving everyone is very hard: I only saved two of the eight characters the first time around (Sam and Emily). I'm looking forward to restarting in the hope that I can somehow get at least a few more people through &quot;until dawn&quot;.<br /><br />The most innovative aspect of the game is &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot;: a build-up of small, seemingly insignificant changes that may have devastating consequences down the line. This feature shows itself even in the first play through, as an in-game menu screen tells you which decisions you've made and gives subtle hints as to how you're doing. It's not just the illusion of choice - if you mess up too often, friends may become enemies, making it harder for characters to survive. Sometimes, a small mistake will be recoverable, but the mistakes do mount up, and sometimes the choices made leave no way out. At the game's end the sun rises, but who will be there to see it is up to you.<br /><br />My only criticisms so far (all but the first one are very minor nitpicks):<br />1: It's a PS4 exclusive. I know, it's just business, but I think everyone should be able to play it on whatever platform they happen to own. Sony's sales of their console should be based on how good their hardware is, not on how many games they can offer as exclusives.<br />2: The camera sometimes doesn't feel as if it's showing enough of the scenes, and it can make movement tricky in darker areas, but then again, that may be a conscious decision because of the need for a survival horror game to be claustrophobic.<br />3: The voices are sometimes out of sync with the characters' mouth movements (happens a lot when replaying chapters).<br />4: The characters' heads seem kinda wobbly at some points (it's obvious during the map scene in the basement). It's very subtle, but it is noticeable.<br />5. There is no way to adjust the screen size in the game - on my TV it's still playable, but some items on the screen edges are clipped.<br />6. The pre-order DLC is just a small inconsequential scene tacked on to the end of chapter 2. It's almost like a deleted scene in a movie and it kinda messes with the pacing. I was kind of expecting a little more.<br />7. Each character's menu screen shows how that character is getting along with the others, but while this is nice, it isn't really clear how this is factored into game play or how (or if) you can rebuild a faltering relationship. On the other hand, maybe making it too clear would make the game too easy.<br /><br />Common criticisms I've seen:<br />1. It's &quot;just&quot; an interactive movie. Okay, even if that were the case, so what? It's a great experience and a lot of fun. But the criticism has no merit - unlike most interactive movies, this one keeps the player fully engaged. At no time did I feel like I could sit back, uninvolved, and just watch the drama play out.<br />2. Two of the characters are predestined to get to the final scene. The developers sometimes mask this with quick time events that focus on saving other characters. Is this a flaw? I'm not sure. However, I think it's a better solution than the alternative, which is a game that would end very quickly for less skilled players.<br /><br />Pre-release hype for this game was unaccountably low. At a guess, Sony's marketing team just didn't know how to sell the game, so it received the minimum pre-release advertising. I'm guessing some marketing executives are being slowly tortured to death in Sony's secret underground lair.<br /><br />Altogether, I had a blast with this game, and I think a lot of other players will too, even if this type of game is not their usual fare. For me, this is not just one of the best survival horror games I've ever played, but if it were a movie, I'd say it would be the best horror movie since The Cabin in the Woods. Yeah, it's that good. I will be very surprised if this game doesn't gather a few of the most prestigious Game of the Year awards.e map scene in the basement). It's very subtle, but it is noticeable.<br />5.

I mean, you can wither get a 500gb version for $345 or pay the extra $45 and get 1TB (double the storage?) The 500gb console can probably hold like 20 games while this can hold a ton. I have both Halo and Far Cry 4 on this beautiful disaster and I have only used 11% of the capacity. Being Far Cry is like 20gb and MCC is like 60gb. Not to mention the operating system and files for the console take up more space than the games.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with the 1TB. There is no reason to get 500G now this model is out. Unless you're seriously strapped for cash it's a harder decision, but if your so strapped - don't buy a console.<br /><br />As for Halo bundled with it, the game is actually not very good. It'll take you ages to get into a lobby and the single layer campaigns are just plain boring. I only play co-op on the story for this reason. It seems like the stories are all there to just grind out the 6k achievements you get for doing them.",2015-08-25

Currently I'm rating this a one star because it's faulty on release. I'll keep updating as days past. Hopefully this doesn't keep happening.<br /><br />*** UPDATE *** 8/26/2015<br /><br />Game stopped freezing as of today. The glitch could of been EA servers causing a timeout issue when Tuning is being updated? I'll update my review once I play a few days of it.<br /><br />*** UPDATE **** 8/31/2015<br /><br />THE GOOD:<br /><br />- Graphics are enhanced, but nothing &#34;wowing&#34;.<br />- GUI is revamped and is a little smoother.<br />- Animations have been improved to match physics.<br />- The ignite engine is finally showing itself on the Xbox One.<br />- Gang tackling is not limited by a certain amount of players. It's a nice touch!<br />- Different perspective views for replies and highlights.<br />- The new &#34;battle in the air&#34; is exciting. I love how the WR's and defenders go at it.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br /><br />- MUT is still terrible in my opinion. It's All About The Microtransactions. Current roster and fantasy roster game play is where it's at.<br />- Sound effects are basically the same. It's nothing thrilling.<br />- The songs are terrible! I disabled all the &#34;songs&#34;. It's far by the worst Madden music.<br />- Commentary is recycled from the last 3 Maddens.<br />- Throwing mechanics are still terrible.<br />- Players (One cut RB's, speed players etc.) don't feel fluid.<br />- They claimed to fix the off sides glitch. It still occurs...a lot. Other bugs and glitches occur BUT hopefully patches fix these.<br />- Rosters are not accurate. Some players are missing and some shouldn't be in Madden this year.<br />- The load times are insane. I know content has increased because of the &#34;next generation of Madden&#34; but this shouldn't be happening to this extent. Load times come from bloatware coding and copy/pasting old generation code.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br /><br />Madden 2016 is decent...at best. EA tries to create or bring back &#34;new content&#34; but they almost always fail to execute. Also, EA keeps recycling content over, over and over. It's 2015, almost 2016. Fans want great sound effects, attention to detail (not grass), commentary and overall realistic football game play. We don't care for MUT (some may though) and bogus microtransactions as content in a football game! I've been playing Madden since it's 1992 edition on Sega. I stopped playing Madden in 2004 when NFL 2K5 arrived (It sucks it only lasted a year. EA knew it would lose Madden and took actions on purchasing NFL licenses etc) . However, I came back to Madden when the 2010 edition was released. Now about 6 years later...I think it's time to stop giving $60 to EA for Madden.er, over and over. It's 2015, almost 2016.

It reduced the characters down to stereotypes, making some characters, like Teddie, insufferable. The story is nearly non-existant and replaces S. Links with short cut scenes, leaving major sections without any character interaction or plot development. The combat is awful, getting rid of the 1more system in favor of boost, which was a poorly conceived downgrade. The characters go as a group instead of one by one, so many times a healer would heal themselves because their target died before their turn. I didn't hate the game at first. Even with paper thin characters and downgraded combat, I was enjoying the experience. The date cafe was a particularly fun dungeon that paired you with any character, including the other protagonist. That was right before I realized what this game really is though. Grinding. I watched five hours of cut scenes (which is insultingly low for a persona game), fifteen hours of exploring the dungeons and doing puzzles, and seventy hours of grinding. Persona 3 and 4 were both balanced to make grinding a last resort if you skipped too many fights. Here, it's basically essential if you even want a chance to beat the game. Reducing difficulties does nothing, so this is basically a minimum time requirement to beat the game if you don't exploit the auto-death spells like everyone kept telling me when I asked about the insane time. If I have to exploit poor gameplay to get through the game in a reasonable time, the game is doing something wrong. Do not waste money on this. Buy Persona 4 Arena Ultimax instead, which has DLC for the first games story. It is at least has 200 times more story, the characters aren't cardboard cutouts of their previous selves, and it's a pretty forgiving fighting game with the auto-combo system.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00KBD4SJA Persona 4 Arena Ultimax - PlayStation 3]]",2015-08-25

In part because he's never seen the show but also because he's used to more advanced gameplay. The side-scrolling platfomer just didn't hold his attention.

If you don't have an internet connection and at least an xbox live silver acct, do not buy this game because you're not going to be playing it.  At all.  If your xbox 360 doesn't have more than a 4gb hard drive - do not buy this game because you cant even install it.

The ps3 to ps4 upgrade is very nice and very appreciated.  The issue at hand here is the port or remaster, whatever you want to call it. There are great remasters out there. Tomb Raider from PS3 to PS4 is one of them. I still know some PC gamers that are jealous because the PS4 Definitive Tomb Raider is better than their PC Tomb Raider. As for PS4 Dishonored, if you have a high end PC and a PS4, just stick with the Dishonored PC that you already have. But to answer the question, is this PS4 Dishonored better than PS3 Dishonored. Yes, very much so. Graphically.  There are some great port jobs out there. TLOU, GTAV. PS3 to PS4, you can tell worlds of difference. I hear the Prototype PS3 to PS4 port is no good. I played Sleeping Dogs PS3 and PS4 versions. On that version, I can see the minor improvements. Improvements though minor makes a huge difference when you're playing a game for hours. I would say Dishonored gets a B+ on the port job. They could have done better, but I appreciate the end product they came up with.  Definitive editions tend to price drop like a brick fairly fast. I bought this game brand new at Gamestop just this morning and have been playing it and having a blast doing so. You can wait till this game hits your price point, but yes, this game is a must buy if you don't have a souped up PC to play it in.  Watch PS4 gameplay on twitch and or live from playstation. You can see the difference between the ps3 and ps4 versions. Draw distance is much better. Textures are slightly improved. Lines are finer. It still has an oil painting quality to it. You can still tell the old gen roots in the game. Overall, Highly recommend.  P.S. When the heart tells you secrets, you can hear it in the Dualshock speakers. How cool is that?",2015-08-25

Positives:  - Visuals are fantastic. Players look great and hell even the coaches actually look good. They almost exactly capture Tom Coughlins ancient insect monster look.  -Presentation is vastly improved. There are many new on screen indicators, including catching controls, player milestones and xp gains. The instant visual feedback is very satisfying.  -Commentary doesn't suck for once. Most of the commentary isn't repetitive drivel and is actually accurate. I haven't ran into that moment where you hit your receivers in the hands and he drops it and it's referred to as a &#34;terrible throw by the quarterback&#34; or you accidently throw it right at a defender and it's called &#34;a great play by the secondary player.&#34;  -Most of the bugs have been ironed out. For example I was always annoyed in franchise mode when it gave your players stats from last week and each stat had a 0. That's been fixed. Also most of the funky animation issues have been ironed out.  -Animations are great  -It now takes a realistic amount of time for the offense to run a no huddle, so that can't be spammed as often anymore.  -New mechanics on offense and defense are interesting and work well. Back are the great defensive changes from last year but added to it are new mechanics for the qb, receivers and secondary players. In addition to the traditional bullet and lob passes, you have a touch pass, which is between a bullet and lob and is useful for things like slant patterns. In addition you can aim high or low with the left trigger and bumper, respectively. Now one on one patterns have added depth as you can aim it high and have your receiver go up and get it. This adds excitement to deep routes and makes fades actually work.  As for receivers there are now three options on how to catch the ball. If you want to just make sure the ball is caught, you can press a(x) and he willcommit to catching the ball but the odds for yards after catch are low. If you press x (square) you will attempt a run after catch, useful for when you're wide open and want to maximize yardage. And if you press y (triangle) you will do an agressive catch which is great for one on one situations and if you just want to see some highlight reel stuff.  As for the secondary, while in coverage you have the option to play either the ball for an int or the receiver and try to prevent the catch.  -There are some minor changes to MUT and franchise. While not major they do clean up the experience a bit.  -The cover athlete. This didn't actually affect my rating but what can I say? I'm a giants fan.  Negatives:  -Some old issues persist, for example if you get outbid when in an auction house sometimes your coins won't return in time to make a bid. It's an annoyance I had last year and while it's slightly less frequent, it persists and sometimes you have to exit the auction house and reenter just to get your coins back. You can imagine how much of a nuisance that is when you only have 15-20 seconds to place a bid.  -Little change to the old modes and the new one, draft champions isn't all that compelling. At least in my opinion. Other people seem to enjoy it, so take that with a grain of salt. I would love for them to bring back the old practice modes like throwing the ball through rings. Those were a ton of fun.  - There were some issues that seem to have been only present during the 5 day ea access preview. For example during that time there were frequent performance issues, particularly frame rate drops. Also there was an issue where all my MUT cards, including those opened in packs, were blank. However since release, the frame rate has been stable and the blank card issue corrected, so I don't anticipate those being an issue any longer.  -The soundtrack isn't anything to write home about. Can't Feel my Face is my jam, but for the most part the music is pretty unremarkable,again in my opinion.  Overall this Madden was a pretty pronounced improvement over the previous which in turn was a nice improvement over 25. I feel right now the gameplay experience is about as good as it can be. Next year I would instead like to see an emphasis on improving existing game modes and introducing a nice amount of new ones. Maybe a story mode NBA 2K style. That would be freaking sweet.",2015-08-25

I am truly addicted to it , you can play this mode to and also have at least one legend each draft. I have been playing it and it also helps with my MUT team as far as being able to use guys for FREE and determine if I like how they perform on the field,not to mention you get rewards to help you in MUT as well. Its a great and addicting FREE mode that I can't get enough of.<br /><br />In MUT there are more solos and challenges you can play , more content as well.  I am not totally won over with MUT as far as payouts , odds and how the leaderboard is still done by coins and not wins or a points setup but its still a great mode that has more to offer this year and I will have fun playing. While its not setup exactly how i'd prefer I think overall it has improved which tells me there are going in the right direction.<br /><br />Overall , the gameplay is much smoother and improved , the addition of draft champions is alone a game in itself that could keep me busy for months , MUT has improved and the new interactions between the DB's and WR's are a welcome addition as well, when a game moves forward I am always happy.",2015-08-25

This game represents some of the worst that the recent remaster trend has to offer. Unlike most remasters the definitive edition does not seem to increase performance in any notable way, with the game running at 1080p (I think lol its hard to tell with the awful textures) and a sub 30 frame rate. Let me be clear, I like this game, and the definitive edition doesn't really hurt the game, but it doesn't make it any better. As such people who have already played the game on the last gen consoles don't really have a good reason to pick this up, aside from this game's other main selling point which is that it includes all of the dlc for the main game. For a limited time people who owned the original version of the game actually get the definitive edition for $20 as opposed to it's regular $40 selling price.

It's a pretty bland experience for a Neptunia game, but there's nothing to be offended about. If you want to spend 3 hours with your favorite Neptunia character, it's a nice time waster. If you want an in depth idol raising game, I'm assuming there are better. I've never have, or will, play another Idol game because it doesn't look interesting. The Music videos seem complex, but once you realize that moving the camera continuously gives you nonstop points, it becomes about wiggling the camera instead of capturing a good video. I heard it was impossible to lose and I did have to basically force my idol into retirement by never letting her rest to get the bad ending. I can't see you using up all the days up even if you tried. It's a simple game with a simple goal and simple execution. So I give it the simple rating of two stars or four out of ten.

Nearly 2 months! I suppose there must be only one guy working on these. I am not sure.<br /><br />When it arrived, I realized that it did not come with everything listed on the website. The screen protector and earbuds were not included. I thought it was a minor issue so I ignored it. I was happy that it finally arrived. I first tested the video output on my TV and it worked as expected. It's my favorite feature. Next, I tested out the roms that were included and everything worked well. I mainly want to play original Gameboy games.<br /><br />I then decided to check out how the audio works with my headphones. This is where the problems begin. I go to plug in my 1/8&#34; audio jack and the entire port goes straight into the console like it was barely attached to the motherboard. I immediately contacted the creator and it took me 3 days to get him to understand what happened. I'm aware of the language barrier so I had to be patient with him.<br /><br />Once he finally understood, I asked for a replacement, but he told me that he couldn't do that and that I would have to sell it to someone who wouldn't mind a missing audio port. I told him that was not acceptable for a defective item and then he offered me $5 offmy next order of the Crystal Black model. We went about 10 days of back and forth emails. I just wanted to return it and he just sending me a replacement when the next batch rolls out. He refused everything I asked him and he eventually sent me a measly $10 refund to my Paypal. After all of the frustration, I just accepted it. I know I could have disputed through Paypal, but that would have taken weeks and required me to pay $10 just to return ship. I thought it was best to just deal without an audio port.<br /><br />I ended up taking it apart to remove the audio port that was rattling around inside and I noticed that there is very little solder on most of the contacts. I may attempt to solder it back on, though I have little skills to do so.<br /><br />I just want to let everyone know that quality is not guaranteed with the Revo K101+. The creator was not rude, but I had a difficult time getting my problem solved for the broken audio port.",2015-08-25

Bethesda is no newbie to the RPG world and Skyrim is the fifth installment of an already very well developed video game franchise and virtual world. Tamriel is a huge land full of rich history, lore, legends and adventures and Skyrim further developes Tamriel even more than it already is. Skyrim is easy to play, easy to learn and really tailors well to individual styles of play. Skyrim is a true Open World game and one of my favorites in the genre (only surpassed by Fallout: New Vegas because the amount of control you have over the events and outcomes of that game is astounding). Skyrim has a wonderful and rich storyline and gameplay. It can easily entertain for 200+ hours on just the base game. That being said it is worth the extra money to buy the legendary edition - you won't regret it. The legendary edition adds hundreds more hours of game play not to mention a separate land (Solstheim) and 2 separate worlds (Soul Cairn and the Forgotten Vale)  and the ability to build your own house (within limits). I own Skyrim on 2 platforms the base game on the Xbox 360 and the Legendary edition on the PC. I would strongly advise that you buy Skyrim for the PC. If PC has the ability to play Skyrim than mods can really rejuvenate and enhance a 4 year old game and make it feel new again not to mention add hundreds of hours to game play, improve game play, fix bugs, and allows you even more customization than you already had to begin with. So if you ever need a new game to play Skyrim is the way to go. Always.",2015-08-25

Lets start by saying this is a solid football sim that gives us something that is better then nothing. With no competition it really is hard for EA to innovate anything ground breaking. Some people will get excited for the new pass catching buttons. However if you play on All-Pro or above they add little to nothing in value. Half the time the button you press isn't what happens anyway. The New fantasy draft mode is fun once or twice but isn't something we will all be playing 6 months from now. Micro-transaction Ultimate football is back and as lame as ever. Touted as the most played mode in Madden I don't know a single person who plays Ultimate team mode. If you like paying more money to get into a fantasy draft franchise go for it the rest of us are laughing at you.<br /><br />Honestly Madden has because something of a standard then a trend setter. You get what you expect with a few new fresh coats of paint each year. Its not a bad game, it doesn't deserve 1, 2 or even 3 stars. Its a solid 4 star experience that needs some competition to push it to the next level. If you can wait until November the game will be 10-20 bucks cheaper as it is every year.<br /><br />With all that said I have to recommend EA Access for nothing else than the Discount on games. I went in thinking that the 10 hour trial wasn't worth the 5 bucks I paid for EA Access however when I purchased Madden from the Xbox live store I only paid $53.00. Essentially it saved me 2 bucks and I got the trial free.",2015-08-25

I sent it in for warranty replacement, and it has been there ever since. They sent back a broken replacement without the cables, then they sent the wrong cable, then I sent everything back again and I still have no headset. I paid nearly $400 dollars, and I have literally nothing to show for it but frustration. The warranty case with turtle beach was opened on June 19. Months later, I still have no headset. The customer service is atrocious. They are sarcastic and dismissive, and have no idea what they are doing. I am convinced they are only trying to prevent warranty replacements from happening. Here is an actual excerpt from one of the emails they sent me:<br /><br />&#34;The cable you received for use is exactly the same in all functions. Color change and the angle on the plug do not alter its core function, which is why you received it. Thank you for eventually trying to use it so we could verify if your problem was cleared up or not.<br />Is this the exact same problem you had previous? As the full headset was swapped out and the cable as well we want to be sure the acu is not at fault in this case.<br />The XP7 is not available in a finished good replacement fashion. That is partly why we replaced just the headset in the first place as you had indicated an issue with just it.&#34;<br /><br />I can not believe how paying absolute top dollar for a supposed &#34;best of the best&#34; headset has cost me time, money, and left me with nothing. I have been patient, and all I received from Turtle beach are pre-canned messages and outright lies.<br /><br />The headset itself is mediocre at best. The leather was decent enough, but the band is not really adjustable (height but not width) and there is a rattling squeaking noise when you move your head around while wearing it. The audio quality is good - if a bit bass heavy. Clarity is lacking and there are MAJOR issues with the driver and software that the USB ACU use to create the digital surround. I had to use optical audio to get it to properly have separate volume control for chat and talk - so if you don't have optical - this is a bad choice.<br /><br />I would literally buy ANY other headset than this one. This Turtle Beach has been the worst experience I have ever had buying something anywhere, let alone the internet. The company happens to have 27 claims against them with the Better Business Bureau already, and will be getting another shortly.<br /><br />If the technology were the best, it still would not be worth dealing with the company. But the fact is its not even that great of a product to begin with. The mediocre sound and poor craftsmanship (only nice thing is the soft leather) leave you with a bad product for an egregious price. And god forbid you get one of the many lemons they ship out. You will be in warranty replacement hell until you give up.<br /><br />Shame on TurtleBeach, this was my fourth headset I bought from them - but I will never allow anyone I know, not even a complete stranger, to suffer through what I have been through. Please, if you have any self respect at all, if you want a headset that works, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.MAJOR issues with the driver and software that the USB ACU use to create the digital surround.

Think: if the Fallout series and the Crysis series had a baby, it would be Deus Ex HR) and I have yet to finish Hitman, but it's pretty good as well.

The narrative is well written and is inspired by the 80's and 90's &#34;slasher&#34; horror films (Friday the 13th, Halloween, Saw) as well as supernatural horror.  From the beginning, the characters and the setting are intentionally stereotypical: A group of upper/middle class teenagers in an isolated region of the country side.  Even the character archetypes are all reminiscent of the typical horror flicks that are released around October: The jock, the clown, the arrogant cheerleader, the attractive 'nerdy' girl, the token minority, etc..  The setting for the story is designed in such a way to induce a constant feeling of isolation in the player. Add to this the excellent ambient sound quality plus the top-notch graphics (even by the standards of a PC gamer), and you have for yourself one atmospheric and engaging adventure game.  UD is simply much more than &#34;just another interactive movie.&#34; This is because the optional element of exploration not only fleshes out the details of the main story, but can potentially change its course with regards to death/survival of each character.  Simply put, the more one explores the various dark and eerie areas, the more he/she will feel rewarded.  Another aspect of the game is the knowledge that even the smallest decisions can have drastic consequences.  I will not go into too much detail regarding this &#34;Butterfly Effect&#34; for the sake of keeping the review as spoiler-free as possible.  Suffice to say, it is intended to make the player ponder his/her every move and adds replayability to the game.  What UD isn't:  The horror elements in this game are based on the aforementioned movie genre.  Hence, you will witness elements of gore, jump scares, eerie music, mystery, etc...  Do not expect the same type of horror as in games such as Amnesia or Condemned.  The game is also heavily story-driven with simple control mechanics.  The gameplay is not meantto be complex or challenging.  Pros: -Well-written, engaging story -Multiple characters with distinct personalities -Atmospheric and immersive environments -Exploration is rewarding and helps to flesh out the story -Multiple playthroughs yield different outcomes  Cons: -occasional frame rate drops. -Simple gameplay mechanics could possibly turn off the more hardcore gamer -Some might initially find the story/characters too cliche.",2015-08-25

This year's game host new features and old favorites that should appeal to anyone who has been a fan of the Madden Series. I will go over all the different modes you have to play. One of the new features that brings a whole new experience to the game is Be the Playmaker. You now have three different catch options to chose from. They are as follows.<br /><br />1. Aggressive catch: This is a high risk/high reward option. Say you are down a score with little time remaining on the clock and need a big play. Using the aggressive catch could provide you the score or yardage needed to win the game. But beware, your receiver has a lower chance of catching the ball. It could however, be just the thing to lead your team to victory.  It's all up to you now.<br /><br />2. Possession catch: You this when you need a clutch pass to your receiver. You most likely won't get any additional yards after the catch but it comes in handy when you need a big play from your QB and receiver.<br /><br />3. RAC Catch: Look to use this play when you need your receiver to make the big play and turn it up the field for more addition yardage after the catch. I would only use this when he's pen because you do have a much bigger chance of throwing an interception id he's cover well.<br /><br />Another new feature in this year's game is called Draft Champions. I will be honest, when I first heard about this new mode of play, I was not impressed at all. I thought, here we go, another new gimmick I won't be playing. I could have not been more wrong. When I fired up the menu, I saw the Draft Champions mode and said, what the heck, I will give it a try. Now, I'm glad I did. If you are a fan and like playing Fantasy Football as much as I do, this is where you will be spending a lot of your gaming hours in Madden NFL 16. It brings the Fantasy Football aspect to Madden in a way that fun and enjoyable to everyone.<br /><br />The Gatorade Skills Trainer Mode: This is a great place to brush up on your Madden skills. Whether you are a long time player of the game like myself or just starting out, you can learn the ins and outs of the game and the new features that were added to Madden NFL 16.<br /><br />The Gauntlet: This mode was first introduced in last year's game. It's basically a series of drills that will help you become a better overall Madden player. It's a great way to try and beat your scores and improve your overall game.<br /><br />Connected Franchise Mode: A lot of new additions to CFM makes this a more enjoyable experience for guys looking to create and control your favorite NFL Franchise. Everything from a new way to scout your players to giving the Commissioner more options to make your online CFM run a lot smoother than year's past. It's still not perfect by any means but it does show promise for future Madden games.<br /><br />Online Head to Head: If you enjoy playing your friends, family or just looking to for a game to play, this is the mode for you. See how you stack up against some of the best Madden players in the world by going online.<br /><br />Ultimate Team Mode: Build your NFL Dream Team in this mode. Long time fans will enjoy yet another Season of MUT in Madden NFL 16. I know a lot of guys will spend a lot of time and effort in creating their Ultimate Team. The more wins you get, the more coins you can earn in order to strengthen your squad.<br /><br />Practice Mode: Need some extra time with your team to learn harness your Madden skills, then practice mode is for you. Learn your team's playbook backwards and forwards by spending time going over your go to plays. It's time well spent if you are a serious Madden gamer.<br /><br />Super Bowl 50: It's the Pittsburgh Steelers vs. the Arizona Cardinals in this fictional Super Bowl 50 matchup. You can replay this opening of Madden NFL 16 as many times as you want. It's a great way to get a taste of the game.<br /><br />In closing,Madden NFL 16 is just a flat out fun game to play for anyone who has enjoyed previous versions of the Madden series. It's not without is faults however, but has more than enough good traits to keep you coming back for more. This is the game Madden fans have been waiting for. I, for one, am glad Madden Season is finally upon us!",2015-08-25

Madden NFL 16 for the next gen Playstation 4 and Xbox One will contain the new features that are highlighted in commercials and reviews. But for last gen, absolutely nothing is changed. It's the same game as last year, just with a nice hefty sixty dollar price tag. If you own Madden NFL 15, or heck, the last two before that. You're basically getting the same game.<br /><br />If the updated roster means anything then I guess I would barely recommend it. But even then I would suggest waiting for the price to drop. Not everyone can afford the Playstation 4 as of yet, but that shouldn't give EA the right to give consumers an identical copy of last years game and expect players to be happy paying full price for a inferior version. The only other positive of buying the newest Madden on PS3 is that the previous game will have less players to match up against sense its outdated, and having the newer version would most likely give you more opponents to play against.<br /><br />The PS3 like any other last gen console will always get inferior ports until the system retires, it's the way the business works. This review was just meant as a warning to anyone who may not be familiar with EA's lovely practice of releasing carbon copies for everyone to be disappointed in.",2015-08-25

This is my opinion. Don't get cranky because I don't like this game.<br /><br />With that out of the way, this is another year of EA sucking $60 out of wallets for not much more than upgraded rosters. This is another year where the mechanics of the game feel just like every other Madden game. Another year of these 'new' features promised by EA to 'change the game' when I don't believe that is the case at all. EA has done a great job at 'forcing' consumers to purchase the new game each year just so they can enjoy new rosters. I'm honestly curious as to how many people would actually purchase the game each year if EA offered roster updates for the previous year as well. My guess is that they would lose out on a lot of money. For that reason alone, it makes sense for them to lock down the fact that users have to buy the new game if they want to play with the new people. As a corporation, I get it. As a consumer that has to spend $60 for that being the (for the most part) largest feature each year, it pisses me off.<br /><br />These 'new' additions of Total Control Passing and Integrated Broadcast Graphics are the same features that EA boasts are new and improved each year. If you'll recall from Madden 15, EA released a 'Best of Broadcast' function that claimed to include new broadcast and cameras that capture the emotion of every play from fresh new perspectives. The Integrated Broadcast Graphics of this year claim that the playmaker highlight reel has new player spotlights, dynamic goals and achievements, and innovative on-the-field cameras that bring you closer to the game than ever before. I just feel like EA is beating a dead horse each year, and I'm fed up with it.<br /><br />I find myself buying these games each year with the hope that EA will produce a game that feels fresh and new, deserving of a new $60 rather than pumping out roster updates and claiming to be the newest and best. Unfortunately, this is going to be my last Madden purchase until I see something that is actually game changing. I'll stick with a previous version and just download my own custom rosters that fellow Madden lovers provide to the community.<br /><br />I wish I had positive things to say about this game, but I don't. I'm just tired of pretending that this is a great game just because it's new. Maybe I'm getting older and finding that this isn't what I'm looking for in a new game. Maybe I'm just coming to terms with the fact that the Madden franchise just isn't what it used to be. Whatever the case may be, it pains me to say that I don't like this game, but I'm not scared to admit it anymore.ew $60 rather than pumping out roster updates and claiming to be the newest and best.

This year's game host new features and old favorites that should appeal to anyone who has been a fan of the Madden Series. I will go over all the different modes you have to play. One of the new features that brings a whole new experience to the game is Be the Playmaker. You now have three different catch options to chose from. They are as follows.<br /><br />1. Aggressive catch: This is a high risk/high reward option. Say you are down a score with little time remaining on the clock and need a big play. Using the aggressive catch could provide you the score or yardage needed to win the game. But beware, your receiver has a lower chance of catching the ball. It could however, be just the thing to lead your team to victory.  It's all up to you now.<br /><br />2. Possession catch: You this when you need a clutch pass to your receiver. You most likely won't get any additional yards after the catch but it comes in handy when you need a big play from your QB and receiver.<br /><br />3. RAC Catch: Look to use this play when you need your receiver to make the big play and turn it up the field for more addition yardage after the catch. I would only use this when he's pen because you do have a much bigger chance of throwing an interception id he's cover well.<br /><br />Another new feature in this year's game is called Draft Champions. I will be honest, when I first heard about this new mode of play, I was not impressed at all. I thought, here we go, another new gimmick I won't be playing. I could have not been more wrong. When I fired up the menu, I saw the Draft Champions mode and said, what the heck, I will give it a try. Now, I'm glad I did. If you are a fan and like playing Fantasy Football as much as I do, this is where you will be spending a lot of your gaming hours in Madden NFL 16. It brings the Fantasy Football aspect to Madden in a way that fun and enjoyable to everyone.<br /><br />The Gatorade Skills Trainer Mode: This is a great place to brush up on your Madden skills. Whether you are a long time player of the game like myself or just starting out, you can learn the ins and outs of the game and the new features that were added to Madden NFL 16.<br /><br />The Gauntlet: This mode was first introduced in last year's game. It's basically a series of drills that will help you become a better overall Madden player. It's a great way to try and beat your scores and improve your overall game.<br /><br />Connected Franchise Mode: A lot of new additions to CFM makes this a more enjoyable experience for guys looking to create and control your favorite NFL Franchise. Everything from a new way to scout your players to giving the Commissioner more options to make your online CFM run a lot smoother than year's past. It's still not perfect by any means but it does show promise for future Madden games.<br /><br />Online Head to Head: If you enjoy playing your friends, family or just looking to for a game to play, this is the mode for you. See how you stack up against some of the best Madden players in the world by going online.<br /><br />Ultimate Team Mode: Build your NFL Dream Team in this mode. Long time fans will enjoy yet another Season of MUT in Madden NFL 16. I know a lot of guys will spend a lot of time and effort in creating their Ultimate Team. The more wins you get, the more coins you can earn in order to strengthen your squad.<br /><br />Practice Mode: Need some extra time with your team to learn harness your Madden skills, then practice mode is for you. Learn your team's playbook backwards and forwards by spending time going over your go to plays. It's time well spent if you are a serious Madden gamer.<br /><br />Super Bowl 50: It's the Pittsburgh Steelers vs. the Arizona Cardinals in this fictional Super Bowl 50 matchup. You can replay this opening of Madden NFL 16 as many times as you want. It's a great way to get a taste of the game.<br /><br />In closing,Madden NFL 16 is just a flat out fun game to play for anyone who has enjoyed previous versions of the Madden series. It's not without is faults however, but has more than enough good traits to keep you coming back for more. This is the game Madden fans have been waiting for. I, for one, am glad Madden Season is finally upon us!",2015-08-25

Plenty of stealth, deliberation, strategy, and reward for being careful and thoughtful about how you proceed.  Deployables can be retrieved (a great jump forward from SE2).  The North African setting is compelling, and particular care is taken to reproduce vehicles and equipment with excellent attention to detail.  It has the &#34;kill cam,&#34; for the bloodthirsty amongst us, and there's nothing like arcing a 500 meter shot right into the forehead of your objective.  Have played through multiple times, and it remains extremely enjoyable.  While it can be played as a twitch fest (just fire off an unmasked shot and then tackle the enemies that come running), it's vastly more rewarding to sneak through the levels, taking stealth kills, masked shots, and laying traps.

US,42046550,R2QFEXT342Q7NI,B00DD0B1R0,133719546,Super Smash Brothers,Video Games,4,1,1,N,N,Just as good as the Wii U version,"First off, the roster. It has over 50 characters, including Mario, Link, Pikachu, Kirby, Samus, Sonic, Donkey Kong, Mega Man, and even Pac-Man. Of course I'm not going to list everyone but those are some of the most recognizable ones. By far the biggest and best roster in the entire series. Everyone that should be there is.<br /><br />Next one's pretty important, the physics. It's absolutely nowhere near the fast paced, aggressive style of Melee. There's hitstun, but only a little bit, meaning that you'll only be able to truly combo at low percents since they'll be hit closer to you. Everybody still floats like a piece of paper, and you have unlimited air dodges. Shields are nearly indestructible and regenerate very quickly, and you can shieldgrab pretty much everything. So defensive gameplay is the norm, which I real hate but eh. You just have to adjust and you'll be fine.<br /><br />Online: It's terrible. Unless of course everyone you play has good Internet. You can set up a room for your friends, send and view replays or play one of the 2 main modes: For Fun and For Glory. For Fun is a lagfest where you play will all items on for 2 minutes. Most people just go there to do &#34;taunt parties&#34; where they just mess around and not attack each other. You can try to crash the party but you'll just get ganged up on. For Glory is a 1v1, 2 stock battle which is still a little bit laggy but not unbearable. I much prefer this on the 3DS version since the 3DS doesn't use tags, which Wii U people can use to swear at you after you beat them. The worst they can do on the 3DS version is furiously flash their name by choosing a character over and over.<br /><br />Game modes: Way better than the Wii U version because 2 words: Smash. Tour. Smash Tour is an absolute blast. You fight a bunch of different enemies while collecting stat boosts across a huge map. At the end you'll either do some sort of Smash match, have a race, or climb a tower to decide the winner. I seriously consider this a reason to get this over the Wii U version since all it has is some slow boring board game called Trash Tour. Other modes are Home Run contest, where you try to hit a sandbag as far as possible (Pst, use Ganonorf and use his reverse B instead of the bat) and Target Blast, which is pretty much launching a bomb bird from Angry Birds. You have to hit a bomb to break wooden obstacles for the best score.<br /><br />As usual there's Classic Mode and All Star like all Smash games. This time in classic mode, you set the difficulty on a scale of 0.0 to 9.0, much like Kid Icarus Uprising (Sakurai bias lel) and each round you have to choose one of three paths.<br /><br />And now there's DLC. It's kinda overpriced in my opinion ($2 per stage, $5 per character) but LUCAS IS BACK so I doesn't freaking matter.<br /><br />Amiibos are basically just a CPU you can train yourself. It'll also give you cool stuff, like gear and trophies. You can go get a Mario amiibo at WalMart for about $12. Don't worry there's a billion of 'em. If you want any other character you can get them from those lovely scalpers for around 60-70 bucks.<br /><br />This game also introduces custom moves, which lets you change a character's B move (Ex: Changing Mario's Fireball to Fast Fireball) and give them equipment, which you can use to make them faster, stronger, or more defensive.<br /><br />You can save pictures by pausing the game and pressing L/R. All of your pictures are saved to the album AND 3DS Camera. You can attach that picture to make a Miiverse post (Don't expect anyone to notice it since the Snapshot Community is dead)<br /><br />And of course, it's portable. Smash anywhere. It's awesome.

US,34927213,RXKUNC0IQIW5P,B00YSAXP0U,610544472,HORI amiibo Collect and Display Case for Nintendo amiibo Figures,Video Games,4,9,10,N,Y,"Over all, decent.","Ok, after reading other reviews from others who purchased these, here are the points they were right on:  1)The plastic isn't as clear as it could be 2)They are stackable 3)Bulkier Amiibo do fit well.  I also agree with the poster who said &#34;There should be a flat rate for a case of them.&#34;<br /><br />Now as for my opinions/experiences:  1)They are a very sturdy made product 2)They can be scanned on your Wii U pad and your 3DS with the Amiibo pad option.  The down side is they don't always read so well because the case bases are big and a little unhandy which leads to my next point 3)While the case measurements are nice they take up more space than you might expect.  If you only a casual collector that just has a few Amiibo these are great.  They are also great for the serious collector(like myself) keep in mind the space they take up.  I do love being able to display them and can still use them for playing games.  I would give this 4 and a half stars if this rating system could.<br /><br />Update:  I have ordered a few more of these and the plastic is clearer than the first batch.  Maybe Hori got the memo from the one who brought up that complaint.  Also these cases will not hold the amiibo/skylanders, Hammer Slam Bowser and Turbo Charge Donkey Kong and while it will house Yarn Yoshi they will not stay in place.<br /><br />Update:  I heard that these cases are going to be discontinued.  I managed to get many of them from GameStop because they are marked down half price.  I bought all the ones within a hundred mile radius of me.  They are shipped to my main store.  With the huge amount of Amiibo from May to July for a total of 15 this year I figured this product would be in more demand than ever.<br />If you are looking for these try the GameStop stores near your area too.  They should ship any and all from a hundred mile radius to the main store you haunt.  Good luck.",2015-08-25

I went through a Best Buy, GameStop, Target, and then finally ended at another GameStop where they had only three copies left in stock (I had to call ahead to reserve one).<br /><br />Anyways, when I finally got home and popped the disc into my PS4, I was already getting anxious whenever I stumbled upon the main menu. The music of the game was already immersing me into the eerie state of the story, I had goosebumps of an incoming fear.<br /><br />I haven't completed the game yet but after playing through about an hour of it, I'm already amazed. I think the last time I jumped so much was when I played P.T. for the first (Silent Hills Playable Teaser). There was one scene where my wireless headset almost broke because I literally flew out of my chair in fear and my headset went flying off my head (thankfully my soft carpet broke its fall), but make sure you bring extra pairs of underwear before hitting &#34;New Game&#34; on the main menu.<br /><br />A feature I really like about the game is how you can see how a character's relationship with another character changes as you make decisions along the story that effect that character.<br /><br />In the final verdict, I recommend this game to anyone who loves the horror genre in general. Someone who loves getting scared by endless jump-scares, following along the personalities of a variety of characters, and being immersed into a story that makes you think and sit at the edge of your chair. P.S. Seriously, at least consider my underwear advise.",2015-08-25

You wont be able to play online or with anyone else, just start up maps and sit there by yourself offline, unless you play in your house on a LAN or over hamachi.  Glu mobil bought the company that runs Battlefront 1&2 (and several other good games) and shut the servers down in 2014.  EA bought the licence, and are making a Starwars Battlefront 3 (without the 3 in the name) but they are known for shutting down servers also.  I used to host games online for this game, it was awesome.<br /><br />Only 16v16 players unlike battlefieds 64v64, but the maps were too small for more players.  The flying in battlefront2 was better on some maps then the first game by far.  The land vehicles are mostly very well done, almost perfect except for one tank on the clonewars maps.<br /><br /> I wonder if EA could help the community make a patch to fix its online server browser.  These servers are very very very cheap to run once set up, there is no reason for a company to ever shut one down, with virtual machines it dosnt even need to be a separate computer, for 15k they could build a computer to run almost every EA game from 1996-2009 online servers (since alot fewer players play them then they used to).<br />Their bandwidth would be as small as the amount of people wanting to play these games online still are in the hundreds not hundreds of thousands anymore.  Guildwars 1 by NCsoft will be running as long as a single person is playing and it runs on the spare bandwidth of GW2 on a old server in a closet.",2015-08-25

I've noted that some of the simple plastic stands have tabs that seem to make the console more stable on its base that insert into the groove along the side of the PS4 - it's fairly stable; however, I feel that these tabs would make it even more so....Additionally, one of the rubber pads underneath the thing magically came off.  I'm blaming the gnomes....Not sure what the story was there - And the other one has to do with after having it for a couple of months, the fans would occasionally start making the most horrendous noise like they were in pain (if machines were capable of screaming obviously).  I would then turn it on and off again to make it stop.

I would've been happy if they just put Horde mode in it, but nope, all you can do with other players is Co-op campaign with one other person or deathmatch online.  As for the remaster, the only difference between the Xbox One and Xbox 360 versions, it's basically just upscaled to 1080p.

You boot up the game, create and name your avatar, and finish a short tutorial to get you familiar with the games mechanics... and then you're set loose it an absolutely huge game world with basically no direction besides meeting a contact. You can do the main storyline if you want, or none of it. You can do any number of guild missions for mages, fighters, thieves, assassins, the army, or religious groups. There are a number of quests unrelated to any factions as well. All of these quests you can either take up or completely ignore. You can become a vampire (or a werewolf with Bloodmoon), and reap all the pros and cons of each transformation. Even better, the GOTY edition comes with 2 massive expansion packs, Tribunal and Bloodmoon, each with their own quests, dungeons, weapons, armor, characters, and treasure to plunder. Playing on PC will allow you access to mods, which can completely change your game. This game barely needs it though, it is a masterfully crafted world with loads to do and locales to get lost in.

When's our Blanc game again?","Hyperdevotion is by far the worst Neptunia game I've played. The only way I can properly express my displeasure is with a list.<br /><br />The Leading Ladies: Noire is the main focus this time, which was immediately a red flag since Noire is third best goddess in most games, but the worst in this because it's Ultradimension Noire, which adds an extra layer of pretentious brat on top of the already bland tsundere (shy girl for the uninformed) character. The other goddesses are far more interesting, with my favorites, Blanc and Neptune, saving every scene they're in. They added a male character, but I didn't even remember him until I glazed over another review. I shouldn't even mention him, considering the plot barely changes without him. No candidates though. Take that as you want, but I see it as a negative.<br /><br />The Supporting Makers: As is usual for the series, the supporting cast is made up of representatives for large gaming companies, stand-outs this time being Final Fantasy and Street Fighter characters. What also stands out is the abhorrent amount of sexual harassment Noire endures. More than half the introduction cut scenes for the characters are her being groped, pinned down, or otherwise molested. The only time I liked this was when she was drugged and about to be turned into a mecha, but that scene would have worked better with her clothes on. And those introductory cut scenes? Those are the only characterization you get for them. Some have cut scenes when you fight them before recruitment, but it's little more than showing the characters visual novel picture. They are all unique in combat, but they needed more character moments to flesh them out.<br /><br />The Gameplay: Weak characters aside, it can work if the gameplay is fun, right? Yes, it can and for a while it did. Then I started noticing how broken the game is. You have a limited height you can fall without taking damage. Enemies do not. You cannot attack over a ledge unless you use magic. Enemies can. You only stay in HDD for 3 rounds. The enemies stay that way all match. You can only use finishers when you have built up your lily gauge. Enemies spam them every turn without any action that would allude to them even having a lily gauge. With how often you fight future or past party members, it's almost impossible not to notice how unfair the game is, letting enemies break rules that you have to follow. It kills the strategy and forced me at one point to continually quit and select make easier until the finishers did no damage to me, but that I'm saving for the spoiler story section. I enjoyed the gameplay otherwise, with one specific section near the end making you carefully choose what units to use, how and when. Too bad the section before it ruined the experience for it.<br /><br />The Story of kinda Spoilers: It's Neptunia one. Arfoire tricks Noire out of her power, she has to go around building a party and they fight Airfore at the end. It isn't that simple when annalyzing plot points, but if you look at it as a whole, it's basically a less in-depth version of the original Neptunia plot with Noire as the lead.<br /><br />Now the Major Spoilers to do With Gameplay: Remember how I said the game was unfair? How enemies could just spam finishers? Well here's the kicker. The game sets you up to either need to grind or exploit the make easier function. Let me explain. In chapter 5ish, Blanc, Vert and Neptune go off to defend their home countries. As you'd expect, things go bad. Vert is mind controlled, Blanc is a zombie and Neptune is patriotic... Yes, it really is as silly as it sounds, but this was a fun mixing up of the gameplay to make things interesting, even though it is when I started to notice how unfair the game was, since Vert is usually useless, but is a god when she can ignore the rules. Then the next chapter is when this game last it's second star. Everyone turns on Noire for basically no reason, so the three remaining goddesses have to saveher. The problem, aside from the AI breaking the rules? All three goddesses went the whole last chapter without getting ANY EXP! This was the point where I lost it, because you don't get to back out and recover your party to grind. You either had to grind levels with only three characters or exploit the restart screen to make the game easier. This was some grade F level game design that I'm surprised more people didn't get angry about. This was the last straw and I just dropped the difficulty to clown shoes until I was able to beat every other party member with only three characters. It's a shame, because right after that is a great segment where you have to carefully divide up your party into four groups, being careful not to leave one group weak on magic, movement or melee. It was an inspired set of levels ruined by the fact I was still pissed about the horrible game design one chapter earlier. The last boss was also OP and I did the same thing because I just wanted to be done.<br /><br />In Short: Don't bother. Get Fire Emblem: Awakening if you like RTS and get any other Neptunia game unless you love Noire and don't mind her being constantly molested. I was close to giving this a two star, since it does have a really good section near the end, but poor story, little characterization and unfair gameplay makes this a game I would rather just forget. I would give it a 3 out of ten, but that isn't an option.",2015-08-25

Have you ever watched a campy horror movie like Friday the 13 and yelled at your tv because of stupid choices the people make...if so until dawn is perfect. Instead of tellin at the tv you will be yelling at yourself. First off let me start by saying the opening scene is straight up awesome it sets the tone for the whole game. The graphics are what truly stands out as it are probably the best out there on ps4 right now. Gameplay is like heavy rain sort of... So if you're thinking you're in control the whole time you're not. It's very cinematic that's why it's an interactive game. The characters are likable and some dis likable and you can improve or decreases stats like humor, honesty, relationship, trust, and stuff like that. It will help shape out the character or characters fate. The game also has great variety in horror, nearly every element in the horror genre is in this game and there are some plot twists that completely changed the game even though it was predictable overall This is a great game one worthy of getting...just maybe wait for it to drop in price.",2015-08-25

Madden is Back!,"[[ASIN:B00W435BU0 Madden NFL 16 - PlayStation 4]]<br />Remember when Madden used to be fun, and you couldn't wait to play your friends, well that game has returned, and returned well.  The Madden 16 Dev Team has done an outstanding job capturing the little things as well as the big things, and that what's made this game one of the best in Madden history.<br />Does that mean this game is perfect? NO! What it does mean though?... It's awesome!<br /><br />The all new passing mechanics, and WR/DB interactions have elevated this series to the next level. There needs to be some tuning, but the overall feel of these new additions to game play, have made the game come alive like never before.<br /><br />I'm sure by now you've heard the new mode called, Draft Champions. Let me tell you this game mode is straight fire, and worth the time to play. I know Madden Ultimate Team can be expensive, and once you fall behind those guys who have 99 everything it can be very challenging to compete, well all that is solved in Draft Champions. One it's free to play, and you draft your team through a 15 round drafting system, that allows you to play with current stars, and Legends all in one. You can compete vs the cpu, or online head to head verse others like yourself. With this mode you can't just play it once, and it will become addicting very quickly.<br /><br />Connected Franchise has taken some steps in the right direction, and you can already see the vision for this mode for many years to come. CFM has had some changes in scouting, and the way you run your draft board in the offseason, and those changes are great little additions to the game.<br />CFM is on the rise, and I'm really looking forward to what is ahead for this mode.<br /><br />There are some bugs, that needs addressing, but all in all this game has captured the vision of Ghost of Madden past, and is looking very, very bright for the future.<br /><br />*Tip* Stay off the triangle button when playing Defense. If you wantto get beat deep every time go for the pick every throw, and you will look like a chump, play smart football, and you will win your share of games!",2015-08-25

The only negative is that I couldn't play Android games that require an analog stick (there are many) and there was not enough buttons for Playstation emulated games.  The Pro is just as well made and even seems to handle Bluetooth connections better while adding analog controls and more buttons.  The layout of the controller is just like a Playstation controller complete with L1, L2, R1, R2 and the sticks double as clickable buttons as well.  Having the analog sticks makes compatibility with games go way up.  The sticks are very accurate for their small size.  I was playing Ape Escape with it like a pro as well as some first person shooters.  The buttons feel solid and have a nice click to them and the analog sticks even have little rubber inserts in the tops of them to give a better grip.  The d-pad is also great and feels like an original NES controller.  (Finding any gamepad in this day and age that has a good d-pad is a feat.)  This thing looks amazing and has a cool LED light effect around the edge.  The lights change color and flashing pattern depending on the state of the controller.  It may not be as comfortable to hold as a full size Playstation controller, especially for long gaming sessions. If you want something portable that is high quality and also looks great, then this is what you want.  Pros:  great retro look with a modern twist, solid build, light weight, good dpad and analog sticks, long lasting battery, easy to charge using phone charger, can connect to nearly anything.  Cons:  Small size and close button placement could cause issues with larger hands.",2015-08-25

This is it.,"This game is basically a no frills, &#34;I just want to shoot and blow stuff up&#34; game. The thin story line is basically there to justify and hang the shooting and explosions on, and doesn't require any commitment (ex: The enemy is called The Target.). You'll almost never run out of bullets, which would defeat the point of the game. My biggest complaint I have for this game, however, is the poor sight system. It's responsiveness is rather sluggish and it can make it difficult to aim at what you want to shoot. However, since you'll almost never run out of bullets, it's not too much of a problem since you just shoot everything in front of you, and you get used to it anyway. Overall, I thought it was a fun game that succeeded at what it was intended for despite having a few flaws, namely the sight system. If you answered yes to the title question, I recommend buying this game.",2015-08-25

Turned me into a penny pinching uncle that could do no wrong on the holidays.,"I got this as a Christmas present for my nephews years ago and it was probably one of the most wonderful gifts I have given them. This edition of Skylanders was cheap, since this game series comes up with new backwards compatible versions of the game every year or so and this is the first version. To a couple of nephews around 5 years old, it was the best thing EVER. Now they have all the skylander stuff : t-shirts, stuffed animals, lunchboxes, backpacks, posters and, of course, the latest and greatest editions of the game and characters every holiday since then.<br /><br />To explain the craze for Skylanders is kind of difficult. If you are someone who just glaces at the price tag and the cost of each new character not featured in the starter pack it can be a little daunting unless you look more into it. A fully up to date edition of a Skylanders starter pack can be found in the store up to $70 + each and the regular figures that go with can be over $10 each, so it can make most people balk at the price tag at first, but the secret is that if you manage to stay a generation or two behind the prices not only drop considerably but you will still have enough content through the backwards compatible figures to keep kids entertained throughout many a birthday.  The starter pack I bought only cost my about $20 because its an older edition, the starter pack comes with three characters that 2 players can play at the same time ( great if you have two bored kids in the house), all three of those characters take time to level up so every birthday or so they are about bored enough to be thrilled to get a new one on the next gift giving holiday.<br /><br />There are a ridiculous amount of characters so I have been spending about $10 bucks per birthday with very little stress involved because apparently an uncle can do no wrong by just sending in the next Skylander character in the set. It's like collecting cards, playing GIJoes, and playing Pokemon all at once for them, until they grow out of it a new Skylander is always the perfect gift. Made shopping pretty consistent on the holidays.hey grow out of it a new Skylander is always the perfect gift. Made shopping pretty consistent on the holidays.",2015-08-25

This game allows players to choose how to tackle each level without being linear. Want to be an assassin and silently take down enemies from the shadows? Or how about run in-guns blazing-with a small rat army? There’s always the option to mix it up and do both!<br />  Each level is well thought out and the combat is highly addictive. I also enjoyed the leveling up system with power/skills; There's teleporting (Which is extremely handy), seeing through objects, and slowing down time to name a few. Did I mention that you can summon a small rat army?<br />  Every character felt unique, plus the voice acting was phenomenal. The story is immersive and I was often asked to make hard decisions pertaining to missions. Little did I know that my choices would ultimately affect the stories final confrontation. Come the last cut scenes, I was emotionally touched, but I won’t spoil anything. For story goers, there is plenty of replay ability to be had here. If that’s not enough, then there’s always the fact that there’s more than one difficulty to play on.<br />  Altogether, Dishonored was a blast and I’m glad I picked it up on a whim despite my skepticism. The graphical improvements are a nice touch and prove welcoming on the PS4. From what I can tell it looks a little cleaner than the PS3 version. Not to mention it comes with all the original dlc.",2015-08-25

I am a Day One owner of the console and picked up this charger about two days later. I had a little trouble getting the battery and cover properly seated, but not to the level of frustration. I am not crazy about the design of the charger itself. The battery must connect with the charging element exactly and if one does not CAREFULLY place the controller into the &#34;saddle,&#34; no charging will occur, even though all appears properly seated. Yes, there is a light indicating that the controller is in place as well as a (very) small red/green light which crudely indicates the charge level of the battery. One would think all is well if the indicator is lit. However, the light does not stay on. Sometimes, the controller would be fully charged even though the indicator was not lit. Other times, there would be no charge. I found the best solution was to NOT sit the charger flat on a table or shelf. When I did this, the battery and charging contact would sometimes separate. Instead, I place the charger on a 45 degree angle, so that gravity aids in pushing the controller against the charging contact.<br /><br />The batteries I began using in November 2013 are STILL viable. I play Destiny 3-4 hours daily and the batteries show no sign of weakening. I give the charger 4 stars in spite of the issues I have had with it. I blame Microsoft for what appears to me to be a lineup of truly odd shaped chargers, the Nyko among the earliest of them. The Xbox 360 had rechargeable batteries that were easily removed from the controllers and snapped into a small, esthetically pleasing charging station. The Xbox One has required the entire controller to be involved in the charging process. What was Microsoft thinking? In the sense of design, it's a step backwards.",2015-08-24

I wore mine out a week ago playing God of War 3 and I was originally planning on sending them to Sony for a replacement. The rubbers wear out on some Playstation 4 controllers that are first generation.  Long story short, delivery was quick, and easy to install. My original were split in the center which created a &#34;lift&#34; on the rubber in the center that could be felt. I was skeptical at first, but after they arrive they fit perfectly. I removed the split rubbers from the old controller by hand. They come right off with no resistance or left over residue. Slide these sideways and they wrap around perfectly. They are slightly loose, but not overly and when playing they stay still. This was probably made that way so you could angle them in from any direction and then straighten them once on. They look nice and make the controller stand out. You could possibly add these on a controller that are not worn out like mine for extra grip.  Pros: solid grip, they look nice once on, adding a little flare and originality to your controller. (i'll upload an image) Cons: The only con I can find by being picky would be they can be ripped while putting them on the controller. This can be avoided by simply going slow and angle them sideways when installing. After in &#34;locks&#34; in one side, you can slide the rest on and pat it on the top so it slides under it.",2015-08-24

Lumberyards, stone cutters (from stone on the map rather than mines).  Harbors, heavy weapons, etc, etc, etc.<br />Perfect controls on the various buildings.<br />Very deep - magic, thieves, etc, in addition to various levels of combat units.<br />Land must be cleared, things must be built.  (Rather than just popping up like Stronghold.)<br />Various civilian units must have tools to do their job - made at the tool works.  It all is awesomely integrated.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />The absolute worst is that the AI goes insane on unit creation.  I was trucking along, doing nicely and built two groups of combat units with 45 each - what I thought was a good army - bigger than most other games.  When I went to attack, they were obliterated by hundreds.  I built hundreds on a retry, with 5 large towers, goaded him into attacking me and it still wasn't enough.  It was ridiculous and ruined this game.  This was on the Easy setting.  On Easy, it should continue with its tower building, but only have a handful of units at each tower, not hundreds overall.  There is no way to control this setting.<br />No walls nor gates and the AI attacks everywhere.<br />The mines seem to stop producing, but there was no reason why.<br />The priest spell to “replenish resources” didn't seem to to anything.<br />The Fog of War is way overdone - most of the time I couldn't see a thing and I really hate that.<br />Defenses are fairly weak.<br />Civilian buildings and civilians are not attacked.  You can only attack defensive emplacements and soldiers.  This is just weird.  Well, some civilians can be attacked, like your geologists (used to find ore) and pioneers (used to push back the territory boundaries).  Buildings explode when territory is claimed, and that, too, is just weird.",2015-08-24

Some of the games in this collection freeze up while your playing particularly Sly 2. If not for that I would have given this collection 4 stars. I love Sly Cooper but after the first game the series became a bit of a drag with the games hitting the 14+ hour mark of gameplay. Completely unnecessary for a platformer. The original game clocked in around 7 hours which was about perfect and didn't drag you down with inane storylines and constant repetitive tasks. There's a lot of poor design decisions in the later games as well. Example: The devs will make it a chore for you to get your next mission which involves jumping up somewhere that isn't immediately obvious and when you finally make it to the designated spot you only receive a mission briefing. All that work just for a mission briefing. Anyway like I mentioned I like the Sly games a lot but I'll always prefer the first game in the series for its more simplistic and straightforward formula.,2015-08-24

It has gone a very long way as you can agree. Being that this is for a next-gen console the graphics are truly stunning and beautiful. France is alive full of detailed buildings and surroundings that truly make you appreciate every climb and synchronization. However, when it comes to the characters, combat system, and glitches, there are many flaws. First, at some points in the game the characters look real and detailed but most often the characters are a little cartoonish and leave out what would make them truly look human. Secondly, what I found to be most disappointing and frustrating is the combat system and stealth. They threw out the easy parry system and chain kills which I thought were pretty badass in AC3 and Revelations. Which brings up the point that many AC games in the past would have new skills or upgrades that had us on the edge of our seat in anticipation. But when it came to a sequel they would throw out what we loved and try to come up with a new, better weapon or skill which failed to impress. The AI in the game are much more advanced, meaning they are quicker, give and cause more damage, and can spot you almost everytime you try to be stealthy. I agree it was easier before but now things have gotten really frustrating. When you try to flee because of the large amounts of enemies (which will happen) it takes more effort to become anonymous and somehow they succeed in shooting from a far distance even while you are moving. Also, the parry system is not as very responsive so often times you will be stabbed. Overall, the game has its hits and misses and I definitely miss the old combat and AI system and the excitement I once had. The one definite hit it has is its graphics, which was barely enough for me to truly enjoy the game.",2015-08-24

And paired with the ZhiZhu®Digital Wireless Stereo Foldable Headphone MP3 Player SD/TF Music FM Radio Battery Chargable Headset, you'll enjoy quiet when they are playing the device and extra time away from tween whining when they use their headset as an MP3 player. Just don't forget to buy the SD card like I did. Both the Sega and the headset accept external SD cards although the Sega takes an SD and the headset uses microSD",2015-08-24

I've been buying it for a few years, and it's saved my kids from cracked screens many times. This particular product, however, is just awful. My husband purchased it elsewhere for my daughter's 3DS XL (not the new 3DS LL). It does *not* fit! The console has far too much room and slips around inside, the case itself is a flimsy design compared to the old 3DS XL armor, it's smooth instead of textured and thus easier to drop, and because it's too large, the console constantly falls out. I have not tried it on my new 3DS LL, but I assume it's sized to fit it. There is a tray or something to adapt it to fit the XL better, but this has fallen out (again, bad design), and without it, the console slides around. (Note: we finally found the adapter tray again. It really does come out far too easily. The whole thing pops apart with ridiculous ease)  If you have the older 3DS XL, *do not buy this*! It's a frustrating waste of money. Try to find the old, console-specific armor instead. And even if the fit wasn't an issue, frankly I wouldn't recommend it anyway due to the inferior design and quality.  Edited to add: For all of you who keep telling me it's MY fault it doesn't fit because it's for the new DS LL, LOOK AGAIN. It clearly states it is for BOTH the old DS XL and the new DS LL. The packaging, which is not shown here, states that as well.",2015-08-24

The most notable for me was the d-pad since I play a lot of fighters. With the original controller, (as good as it is), when I tried to do specific moves that required precise pushing of the space in between the directions, I would have to attempt it multiple times since it was thick and uncomfortable to fully utilize even when doing basic movements. This controller has a slimed-downed d-pad which is much more comfortable and allows easier precision movements. It even feels better for non-fighting games. Second are the impulse triggers which feel much more responsive than the standard one. Sometimes the regular one would seem like it was off a bit with syncing up the rumble to match the corresponding event happening in the game albeit not by that much but still noticeable. It feels more on point with this one. Chat audio seems to transmit clearer through the controller, almost like it got a boost in quality. The differences won't be apparent to you until you really use it for a little while which is why I'm just now reviewing it because I wanted to take some time to adjust to it and figure out whats different with it, and I think that 24 days was plenty of time. Speaking of chat audio, as much as I like this controller it's going to get 1 star knocked off simply because with all the improvements I don't see why microsoft couldn't put in a built-in audio jack. I have the adapter, but it would be a no brainer to me, the $150 elite controller has one so why not this one? I guess if you're going to pay THAT MUCH for a controller, it better have audio jacks built in right? lol. Anyhow, these were my thoughts on the controller, I highly reccomend if you play fighters alot to invest in it ,(the d-pad really is better on it.) Also if you just want a slightly better controller that's not $150 then this might be for you.",2015-08-24

Nearly 2 months! I suppose there must be only one guy working on these. I am not sure.<br /><br />When it arrived, I realized that it did not come with everything listed on the website. The screen protector and earbuds were not included. I thought it was a minor issue so I ignored it. I was happy that it finally arrived. I first tested the video output on my TV and it worked as expected. It's my favorite feature. Next, I tested out the roms that were included and everything worked well. I mainly want to play original Gameboy games.<br /><br />I then decided to check out how the audio works with my headphones. This is where the problems begin. I go to plug in my 1/8&quot; audio jack and the entire port goes straight into the console like it was barely attached to the motherboard. I immediately contacted the creator and it took me 3 days to get him to understand what happened. I'm aware of the language barrier so I had to be patient with him.<br /><br />Once he finally understood, I asked for a replacement, but he told me that he couldn't do that and that I would have to sell it to someone who wouldn't mind a missing audio port. I told him that was not acceptable for a defective item and then he offered me $5 off my next order of the Crystal Black model. We went about 10 days of back and forth emails. I just wanted to return it and he just sending me a replacement when the next batch rolls out. He refused everything I asked him and he eventually sent me a measly $10 refund to my Paypal. After all of the frustration, I just accepted it. I know I could have disputed through Paypal, but that would have taken weeks and required me to pay $10 just to return ship. I thought it was best to just deal without an audio port.<br /><br />I ended up taking it apart to remove the audio port that was rattling around inside and I noticed that there is very little solder on most of the contacts. I may attempt to solder it back on, though I have little skills to do so.<br /><br />I just want to let everyone know that quality is not guaranteed with the Revo K101+.

Instead of the week consuming PC Civ game, you can accomplish this in one sit-down (three hours on easiest, but the difficulties will increase this quite nicely).<br /><br />Multitasking has essentially been removed from Civ Rev. Instead, you can focus on your goals and how you're going to win, and you no longer need to worry about funding that vast horde you built. One thing I found lacking was the diplomacy. Apparently, in order to keep it simple, it has been butchered down to &#34;Give me this, and if you don't, we're at war.&#34; It's every Civ for them self in this game, and if you're near to achieving a victory, they will make a desperate attempt to stop you.<br /><br />Combat still has that good `ole Civ feel of creating a powerful unit form countless victories. Units gain experience, and in Civ Rev also gain ranks, and then eventually purchase upgrades that can change how it fits into your strategy. A problem does arise that you can't upgrade a unit to its next advancement (i.e., you can't improve an archer into a musket man; it is, and will always will be, an archer). You can, however, sell of your units, so you're not forced to go on suicide missions with them.<br /><br />As far as graphics go, they're not top quality, neither are they bad. Fights are fun to watch, and the only annoying thing is your advisors, whose ubiquitous presence and pop-ins will begin to annoy some. But after awhile, they become more like an annoying friend more than anything. The sound isn't much, but this is probably a game where you will find yourself listening to your own music.<br /><br />One thing I'm sure will annoy PC veterans is no control over your map. It's usually one continent with a few islands (don't quote me on that, though), and I believe the size is the same. Still, the maps are different every game, providing an essentially limitless replay ability.<br /><br />Definitely different, but still a great game. $60, though?

While there's no technological reason why it can't do everything they can do, it just can't.  But I love my Chromecast so i'm perfectly content with using it instead of this.  Its just disappointing that this one device can't be the answer to all of my streaming and gaming needs when i travel.<br />I believe Sony pushed this out to try and rev up its Playstation NOW game streaming service, which is currently in Beta.  PS NOW, when it works, works well but expect to run a network cable over to the PSTV because the wifi is unreliable.  My only gripe with the PS NOW service is that I can't find where to adjust the subscription options.  Sony advertises two subscription plans ($20 per month or $45 per quarter) neither are a bargain for the casual gamer who spends less than $240 per year on new games.  It would be nice if my PlaystationPlus membership yielded me at least some discount on PS NOW.  But I accepted that $45 per quarter is a fair enough price.  Only problem is that theres no place to select this.  You sign up for a 7 day trial and once that trial period ends, it automatically rolls into the $20 per month plan.  Sounds trivial, but i can deal with the occasional network blips for $180 per year, but when they force me to pay $240 per year, those things just drive me insane.  Premium price for sub-premium service.<br />Another issue that I have is that not all Vita games are compatible.  Makes sense since Vita was designed with a touch screen, but most games aren't labeled as to whether or not they are PSTV compatible.  You either have to download all your titles, or research each one before you buy.<br />Speaking of downloading...This thing comes with a meager 1GB of storage which will allow you to store one good game.  That's it.  Want more than that?  Gonna have to buy a Vita memory card which costs about 5x as much as every other type of memory card out there.<br />It feels like Sony is doing everything they can to suck as much money out of their customers as they can get.  The problem is, had they done it right, we'd hand our money over willingly but because of the poor execution and corner cutting, I resent every penny that I am forced to give them and refuse to give them one cent more.<br />I fear that Sony will abandon this as a failed effort and we will never get to see the Playstation TV live up to its potential.  Although, if they do, the hackers will turn this thing into the perfect device.",2015-08-24

I got these headphones to listen to classical music and for conferencing with my dev team, hoping to replace my ATH-M40fs studio monitors. Audio quality is important to me, and I want the sound to be as close to a live performance as possible. In general, I don't want my headphones to color the sound at all.<br /><br />My first impressions were mixed, but after my own adjustments, the phones became quite pleasant to listen to. They won't be replacing the M40fs, but they do sound pretty good, and the convenience and freedom is hard to beat.<br /><br />Sections:<br /><br />* Before anything else<br />* Connections<br />  * Microphone<br />  * Analog cable<br />  * Close range performance<br />  * Long range performance<br />* Audio quality<br />  * Equalizer<br />  * White noise<br />  * LF sine waves<br />  * Stereo imaging<br />* Conclusion<br /><br /># Before anything else<br />First, PLEASE NOTE that for best quality, use the optical base station or Bluetooth A2DP, which is designed for high-quality music.<br /><br />Also, note that the default is to process your audio heavily to focus on voice frequencies. This cuts out a lot of bass. MAKE SURE that you switch to game 1 and chat 1 audio profiles, which have flat frequency response for the most accurate sound.<br /><br /># Connections<br />## Microphone<br />If you are on Bluetooth and start using the microphone, the PX51 will switch from A2DP to the Headset protocol, which is designed for telephony rather than music. You can hear when it switches Bluetooth modes with a short series of beeps. If you want to maintain high quality audio while also using the microphone, set your computer's audio out to the transmitter, and use Bluetooth as the audio input, as in the diagram below:<br /><br />PC &#60;-- BT &#60;-- PX51<br />PC --&#62; RCA/Optical cable --&#62; Xmitter --&#62; PX51<br /><br />## Analog cable<br />Although the PX51 can work without the transmitter or Bluetooth, via a 4-conductor 1/8&#34;-3/32&#34; analog cable, consider this a last resort. The sound quality using this cable is horrible, similar to a telephone.<br /><br />I do not have any game consoles, so I could not test the XBox chat cable.<br /><br />## Close range performance<br />I found that at close range, less than about 10ft, the included transmitter gave me the best experience. It allows for finer customizations in the headphone DSP, and had no dropped samples that I could detect.<br /><br />Bluetooth A2DP with my MacBook Pro and my iPhone 6 very occasionally dropped a sample, audible as a tiny click. It’s not as good as the base station at close range, but read on.<br /><br />## Long range performance<br />Moving about 20ft away and putting several walls in between turned the tables in Bluetooth's favor. It dropped more samples as expected, but it recovered in milliseconds. I got every word in my conversations, and didn't miss a beat in my music.<br /><br />The included transmitter, though, would drop out completely for seconds at a time. To reconnect, I had to wait too long once I was back in reliable range.<br /><br />In a nutshell, use the transmitter if you’re close, and use Bluetooth if you’re far.<br /><br /># Convenience<br />Now is a good time to sing the praises of wirelessness. Before, I had an extension cord on my M40fs, and I was always worrying about twisting it and rolling over it with my chair. No more! Such freedom! I love it!<br /><br />## Phone calls<br />The Bluetooth cell phone pairing works excellently. After I paired it with my iPhone, I just pressed a button on the headphones and answered the call without touching my phone at all! No more worrying about fishing it from your pocket or purse! To hang up, just press the button again.<br /><br />Stop for a moment. I didn't have to take off my headphones at all! The music automatically muted. When the call was done, the microphone muted again and my music was back. Is this... heaven?<br /><br />Close, but not quite.<br /><br />## Chat<br />Other buttons controlled the volume of the Bluetooth signal. Unfortunately, there are beeps for audible feedback for Bluetooth, which interferes a little with the music. They were pretty short though, too short to miss any beats.<br /><br />There is also a 0-delay microphone monitor circuit. The volume control for this is on the front of the left earcup. You can mute the mike with a button on the right earcup, which is a little strange, but OK. When the mike is un-muted, you hear rising beeps, and when it's muted, you hear falling beeps. During this time, other audio is blocked, so you might miss a word in the conversation or a bit of music.<br /><br />## Main (game) audio controls<br />While we're talking about volume, the PX51 also gives me a volume control behind on the left earcup for the signal from the included transmitter. Since this pot is not in the audio path, but instead is connected to the processor, there are no scraping noises and pops. If you move it really fast, you'll get a tiny click or two, but that's it. It won't get in the way of your audio.<br /><br />Other buttons on the left earcup switch between DSP profiles. There is a dedicated button to switch to the &#34;Main profile&#34; and others to switch to the 16 (!!) chat and game profiles, which are customizable in Windows. You can make profiles to focus on action, on voice, to compress the volume levels, and much more. As I mentioned above, I prefer sound true to the recording, so I chose game preset 1 and chat preset 1 for flat, unaltered frequency response.<br /><br /># Audio quality<br />The comments from here on were made using an optical link to the included transmitter from my MacBook Pro.<br /><br />If I listened carefully to some orchestral music, I could tell that the bass was slightly quieter on the PX51s than on the ATH-M40fs. Treble was very slightly clearer. The ATH headphones are actually known to be a little bass-heavy, so this result on the PX51 is actually pretty good. I actually started noticing the subtle clicking of the keys on the clarinets and oboes. This was a pleasant surprise, since most games are heavy on explosions and bass, and my biggest worry was that gaming cans would be super bass-heavy. Instead, I found the PX51 to respond better to high frequencies, or as audiophiles say, the cans were &#34;analytical&#34;.<br /><br />## Equalizer<br />Still, I felt the bass was somewhat lacking in the cellos and timpani. So, I went to Parallels (no Mac version for the Advanced Sound Editor) and opened the ASE to put in some manual bass boost. I set a linear ramp in the equalizer from +0 to +3dB starting from 220Hz down to 20Hz. This let the bass section ring out nicely without being too muddy and overdriven. Note that to get the most granualar control over the DSP, you must use the transmitter and not Bluetooth, even if you use A2DP. You do have a 5-band equalizer for Bluetooth audio, but the transmitter gives you 12 frequency bands to play with.<br /><br />## White noise<br />I noticed a very small amount of white noise, independent of the headphone's volume setting. It was similar in volume to the white noise coming from the headphone output on my Kenwood VR-6050 surround receiver (speaker outputs are great, but they scrimped on the headphone out). I noticed this because I've created my own headphone amplifier, which has no audible white noise background. It's easy to forget about the white noise and just enjoy the music though. Most people probably won't care, but I'm picky.<br /><br />## LF sine waves<br />After this listening test, I tried playing LF sine waves. I found that the response below 25Hz is nonexistent. Sound first comes in at 25Hz, quiet, but definite. 30Hz is clearly audible, but 35Hz really booms out, causing unpleasant mechanical clipping. After that, the sound quiets down until by 50Hz, the volume is normal again. This was a pretty grueling test, and does not reflect real usage. However, the lack of response in the ultra LF band is disappointing to me. These frequencies add a lot of richness to classical music, and I think that when people describe headphones has having &#34;tight bass,&#34; they are talking about this frequency band, from ~25-30Hz down into the subsonic range. Still, a lot of people can only hear sounds down to about 35Hz, so this may not be a big deal for them. In fact, that is probably why the cans roar like that at 35Hz; I'm guessing that the guys at Turtle Beach who designed and calibrated the phones wanted all frequencies to be clear down to the limit of their hearing, so they boosted the bass at this point. Good for others, but not so good for me.<br /><br />(When I tested my hearing, I found that I can clearly hear/feel frequencies down to at least 10Hz and can barely detect 20,000Hz. The lower limit is more because of my equipment than because of my senses. 10Hz is like a deep throb which I feel more than hear, and I begin to sense it more as a sound at 15Hz or so.  20kHz feels like a constant pressure on my ears, rather than a sound. Still, I can clearly tell when the sound is faded in an out. HF begins to feel more like sound at about 19kHz.)<br /><br />## Stereo imaging<br />Although the PX51s have some of the frequency characteristics of more open cans, probably due to the small openings between the buttons, I found that the M40fs gave better stereo imaging. This was tested using the Virtual Barbershop. It was harder to tell whether something was behind or in front of me with the PX51, and sounds that were supposed to be right in my ear sounded a few inches away. The M40fs did better, imaging the sounds within two inches of my ears on the sides and clearly differentiating between front and back. Things in front and back also had a better sense of distance than on the PX51, where I couldn't tell how far away sounds were unless they were towards my right or left.<br /><br />I tried using the surround modes, but I concluded that these were designed for gaming and not for music. It felt like they moved the sound further in front of me, which was probably to compensate for the lack of front-back depth I noticed earlier. Unfortunately for classical music, this also moved the echoes from the back of the concert hall forward, and it sounded like I was listening to the concert from another room. This had the effect of making the music flatter and less immersive, even distorting it, as if it was playing through a corridor. The surround modes probably work better for simpler game soundscapes where you need to locate an enemy sniper, and small bands in acoustically-dead recording studios, but these don't match my use case and I didn't test them. I think it would have been better to start off with better acoustics, instead of band-aiding it with software processing.<br /><br /># Indicators<br />## Power<br />As long as the headphones are on, the power button on the left ear flashes blue. I find this rather annoying, and I wish there was a way to turn this off.<br /><br />On the base station, there is a steady blue LED for power.<br /><br />## Charge<br />There is a red charge LED next to the USB mini (not micro) port on the bottom of the right earcup. This turns off once charged. I'd prefer it if this were in a place more visible, since when this is on the stand, the light is invisible.<br /><br />## Link<br />On the right earcup, there is a small blue/red LED to indicate the audio source. When connected to the transmitter, it is steady blue, and when connected via Bluetooth, it is magenta (both the red and the blue sections are on).<br /><br />The base station also has a blue link light, showing whether it detects digital audio on its optical input.

All in all though, I can recommend it for most listeners who want a wireless headset.e a big deal for them. In fact, that is probably why the cans roar like that at 35Hz; I'm guessing that the guys at Turtle Beach who designed and calibrated the phones wanted all frequencies to be clear down to the limit of their hearing, so they boosted the bass at this point. Good for others, but not so good for me.  (When I tested my hearing, I found that I can clearly hear/feel frequencies down to at least 10Hz and can barely detect 20,000Hz. The lower limit is more because of my equipment than because of my senses. 10Hz is like a deep throb which I feel more than hear, and I begin to sense it more as a sound at 15Hz or so.  20kHz feels like a constant pressure on my ears, rather than a sound. Still, I can clearly tell when the sound is faded in an out. HF begins to feel more like sound at about 19kHz.)  ## Stereo imaging Although the PX51s have some of the frequency characteristics of more open cans, probably due to the small openings between the buttons, I found that the M40fs gave better stereo imaging. This was tested using the Virtual Barbershop. It was harder to tell whether something was behind or in front of me with the PX51, and sounds that were supposed to be right in my ear sounded a few inches away. The M40fs did better, imaging the sounds within two inches of my ears on the sides and clearly differentiating between front and back. Things in front and back also had a better sense of distance than on the PX51, where I couldn't tell how far away sounds were unless they were towards my right or left.  I tried using the surround modes, but I concluded that these were designed for gaming and not for music. It felt like they moved the sound further in front of me, which was probably to compensate for the lack of front-back depth I noticed earlier. Unfortunately for classical music, this also moved the echoes from the back of the concert hall forward, and it sounded like I was listening to the concert from another room. This had the effect of making the music flatter and less immersive, even distorting it, as if it was playing through a corridor. The surround modes probably work better for simpler game soundscapes where you need to locate an enemy sniper, and small bands in acoustically-dead recording studios, but these don't match my use case and I didn't test them. I think it would have been better to start off with better acoustics, instead of band-aiding it with software processing.  # Indicators ## Power As long as the headphones are on, the power button on the left ear flashes blue. I find this rather annoying, and I wish there was a way to turn this off.  On the base station, there is a steady blue LED for power.  ## Charge There is a red charge LED next to the USB mini (not micro) port on the bottom of the right earcup. This turns off once charged. I'd prefer it if this were in a place more visible, since when this is on the stand, the light is invisible.  ## Link On the right earcup, there is a small blue/red LED to indicate the audio source. When connected to the transmitter, it is steady blue, and when connected via Bluetooth, it is magenta (both the red and the blue sections are on).  The base station also has a blue link light, showing whether it detects digital audio on its optical input. Another blue light turns on if the optical signal is Dolby Digital surround.  # Conclusion The PX51 is a great wireless headset. Music on them is enjoyable, and that is the most important thing.

However, online reviews are fair, maybe a bit on the harsh side. It is a short game. No way should you spend $60 or $100 on this game (depending on the edition). It's ending felt more like a halfway point to me. The combat could use some fine tuning, but overall not bad. Huge potential for a sequel, however. Not enough emphasis on the supernatural which I hope is addressed in a sequel. Overall the presentation is wonderful (5/5), lackluster gameplay (3/5).

I purchased one of these about a year ago, then another from the same company a few months ago. Guess why I'm on here writing this review? Yep, because the second one I purchased blew up. This is a bad (and very dangerous) product. See below for each experience:<br /><br />Purchase One: Bought the adapter, and it began to overheat a few months later. We learned that we could watch two shows then we needed to turn it off or it would be shot for a day. After a few months of that, we were watching a show and heard a huge popping sound, then saw a small amount of smoke come out of the adapter box. I unscrewed the box (desperate to finish my episode of x-files) to discover that the cheap electrolytic capacitor they had used in the box was only rated for 25V, something that even a first-year engineering student would have laughed at. The cap had physically blown up inside the box. Not good.<br /><br />Purchase Two - Same deal with overheating. Clearly a really bad product. All the same, it's almost impossible to purchase a real one of these anywhere, so we kept using it until we found a genuine one. Within a few months, the x-box will not even turn on; instead, the red warning light just comes on when plugged in.<br /><br />On both models, I looked at the circuit boards inside. They were the cheapest of the cheap horrible manufacturing, look like they were hand soldered in a sweatshop. See picture for the horrible construction and for a look at the cheap inside of this product.",2015-08-24

Granted, candy bars are generally pretty low on my list of things to buy at the grocery store, but that’s not relevant to story. So, I never buy Butterfinger bars. I haven’t in well over a decade. But Hershey or Mars or whoever makes Butterfingers came out with bags of bite-sized Butterfinger pieces. I don’t buy them very often, but relative to less than once a decade I buy them pretty frequently. I’ll have three or four small pieces of Butterfingers, enjoy them, put the bag away and remember I have it sometime later. What I do buy with probably too much frequency is beer. Ales, shandies, stouts, that new craft brew that doesn’t really look that great but I figure I haven’t tried it yet. Butterfingers and Beer are two different types of purchases with the same basic premise, they’re bad for me but I enjoy them to varying degrees.   Helldivers Super-Earth Edition can be a different type of game depending on how you approach it. The game is broken up into bite-sized levels that can take a couple minutes or longer, but aren’t a huge time commitment. On the flipside there are numerous levels, a larger war that acts as a metagame and a lot of unlockables that take a while to unlock.   I’ll be upfront in admitting two things. One, I never played Helldivers prior to the Super-Earth edition. Second, I’m fairly twin stick shooter agnostic. I played through Dead Nation and enjoyed it, but when I was done I was done. Never went back. Halo Spartan Assault was ok but I didn’t finish it which is fairly rare for me. Twin stick shooters are fine, I don’t seek them out but I don’t avoid them like some genres. They are, if you will, candy bars to me. Nice once in a while. Helldivers caters to that with the bite-sized levels. I can burn through one or two and move on with my life. No long playing sessions are required, which is nice. I can pick it up and put it back down fairly quickly and if I’m away from it for a while it only takes a few seconds to get my feel for it again.   On the flipside of that are the beer like aspects of Helldivers. There’s a large war effort going on that completing goals helps move forward by earning influence. There are numerous unlocks to be had and experience is somewhat stingy meaning leveling up is fairly slow. And there are a large number of missions and varied environments to try. The selection of things to do in the game is both broad and deep.   The game plays as a fairly normal twin stick shooter. You are in charge of one soldier that you view from a top down perspective. You move with one stick, aim with the other and fire. There are grenades and secondary items called stratagems that you call down to aid you in your fight. Things like mechs to pilot, turrets, additional weapons, airstrikes, stuff like that. Once on planet you work to complete objectives before being able to extract. You can either play solo, with a group or play in public matchmaking games. Playing solo you have auto-deploys where you are deployed again if you die and if you play in groups it’s up to other group members to save you.   The game has a very tongue in cheek feel to it with cartoon-ish graphics, over the top recruitment propaganda and writing that makes you not take the game so seriously. It helps make a game about death and destruction feel bright and somewhat cheery. The graphics aren’t spectacular, and what little voice acting there is is about average. But the game looks good stylistically. It reminded me of the somewhat cartoony style of Diablo 3.   Co-op definitely makes the game more fun, but that requires having a group of people to play with consistently. If you have that, great, but if you want to play alone, as I have most of the time, the game works fine playing solo. Public match-making can be a bit frustrating as the screen makes it so everyone must be on the screen at one time so if you’re playing with others online and they want to go west andyou want to go east you both end up stuck in the middle running into the edge of the screen. It’s a game that works better alone or coordinating with people you can speak with.   Part of the game’s niche is its difficulty. Much like the Dark Souls series the difficulty is overblown. As long as you’re cognizant of what’s going on and keep track of what munitions you have left it’s not difficult unless you end up getting swarmed from all directions which can happen. The biggest challenge comes from the friendly fire. Resource drops can crush you, fellow teammates can shoot you, your extraction shuttle can kill you, your own turrets can harm you. Everything can hurt everything else, which let’s be fair is what would really happen.   Helldivers Super Earth Edition is a game with a high floor. What I mean by that is that it is generically appealing. Not in being generic but in that it can offer the bite-sized play style for someone like myself who wants to play once in a while for a little while with little commitment. But it also has the deep offerings for someone who wants to get into the game. Someone could invest a lot of time into Helldivers and make it their go to game. It could be bite-sized Butterfingers or Beer depending on what you want to make it.   If you don’t like twin stick shooters then obviously Helldivers isn’t a game for you. Or if you’re looking for a casual game you can zone out and just play it wouldn’t work out so well since it requires a lot of attention. But Helldivers is a high-floor type of affair from my perspective. It’s set up to be played casually if you want, or you can get really involved in it. The Super Earth edition includes all the DLC previously released along with the main game, so new classes and weapons. If you already own the base game it’d be cheaper to just buy the DLC, so this may not be the most economical purchase but if you want the disc version with all DLC it’s a decent game that can fit what you’re looking for.",2015-08-24

The addition of different types of street-style events, particularly the futsal tournaments, gives the game a much more international feel as you work your way up to the top with your squad.  The fact that your players get capped with development points around the level 50 mark also means some strategy is required in building the squad, including your main player/team captain.  It's a bit more FIFA proper and a bit less street oriented in terms of play at times (skill moves aside), but overall is a decent footie game that breaks up the feel of doing the same thing all the time.",2015-08-24

Buy it if you're patient.,"It's hard to recommend the FragFX Shark in any condition or model. My model arrived only a bit used in the mouse button pads.<br />Plugging it in was a cinch. To the Xbox 360, I hooked in my GameStop model wired 360 controller, turned the system on, and from there, it seemed to function well enough, with the d-pad, stick, and mouse all doing as they were labeled to.<br />In games, it's necessary to set the sensitivity much higher than standard, and work from there. I found that in all of the games I tried, managing between in-game sensitivity and the physical sense dial on the FragChuck worked out poorly. The dial seems to manage just how the mouse will handle acceleration more than anything. I found it was best to leave it at zero and work with the sensitivity in-game, and even then, it was never perfect.<br />Controlling games is also a bit harder compared to normal, as there are face button features you are having to do on the mouse. As well as that, the pair is strange with mapping. It makes sense from a controller standpoint, as LB and LT are on the FragChuck, normally in your left hand, while the mouse handles RT and RB on the pads. However, shooters don't work that way unless you are religious to Modern Warfare 3 on the Nintendo Wii, so you'll need to remap the buttons, which has its own trials and trivialization to overcome.<br />The dongle offers a PC mode, however, which makes the pair work as a keyboard and mouse verbatim. For the mouse, it's quite nice to have up to 4 buttons to work with extra, and the mouse wheel even has a Back and Forward button (MB4 and 5 traditionally) mapped to the sides. The mouse, then, totals to 10 distinct buttons with the included Start button. Bare in mind that besides the Back and Forward buttons, they map to keyboard keys, which is negative in the sense that you'll be using the keyboard realistically, but it also allows some games to map to the mouse, incidentally, especially on PC titles like Syndicate, where extra mouse buttons can't be mapped.<br />The FragChuck is also the center to the additions, as rapid fire and setting macros require the FragChuck exclusively. With the widespread complaints of the FragChuck being unable to resync to the dongle, a lot of this sort of detracts from the potential &#34;good&#34; points.<br /><br />Still, it's a nice device hat I use for a couple games, and if I decided to learn how, I would probably switch from my Mazer Type-R mouse to the FragFX Shark fully. As it stands, though, I have a full QWERTY keyboard, and if I want to have a smaller size solution to it, I'd be better to buy a game pad like a Razer Orbweaver.<br />Buy it if you're patient when it comes to mastering hardware and have a setup that is optimal for PC gaming and can accommodate an Xbox 360 well.buttons can't be mapped.<br />The FragChuck is also the center to the additions, as rapid fire and setting macros require the FragChuck exclusively.

US,36999276,R3ULLFKR8BBITV,B00004SW09,262920376,Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 - Sega Saturn,Video Games,4,1,1,N,N,A virtually perfect arcade port of this classic with some bad load times,"One of the reasons I picked up a Sega Saturn, was to get an arcade true port of Ultimate MK3. I wasn't disappointed! Ultimate MK3 on the Saturn delivers in virtually all aspects, and is a great home port true to the original. In fact, it is the only one. Although Ultimate MK3 was ported to the Super Nintendo and the Genesis, they are very different games and are actually watered down versions of MK Trilogy, rather than a faithful port of this title. Not to mention the 16-bit consoles don't have the graphic horsepower to deliver like the Saturn does. In my opinion, this game is what Mortal Kombat 3 should have been. More fighters, more secrets, more stages, more finishing moves, it really has it all! Raiden is missing from this one, but it is related to the story line, as Raiden was not in the original MK3 either. UMK3 on the Saturn delivers fast paced, arcade quality action with every move and finisher you'd expect.<br /><br />With all of the greatness that is this port there are some shortcomings, leading to my one star deduction. Firstly, there doesn't appear to be a way to save your menu settings. 9 of 10 fighting games on the Saturn allow you to save your scores and menu settings, but this feature appears to be absent from this port. Its not a huge issue, but is just a minor annoyance causing you to make your selections over and over again each time you reboot the console. That aside, the main issue is the load times. They are fairly frequent, long and somewhat annoying. The worst part is when you're going to do a fatality, the game has to pause and load right in the middle of it! It really affects the flow of the fatality and I've had guests over who thought the game froze and was in error. I feel like Midway could have avoided this by allowing this game to make use of the 1MB or 4MB RAM expansion carts for the Saturn. Unfortunately, this game doesn't utilize those. Another reason Midway should have made use of the RAM expansion would be to bump up the resolution. While the graphics are quite acceptable, the resolution is pretty low and we've all seen the Saturn do better.<br /><br />Even with the load times, lack of option save and sub-par resolution, this game is a solid port with all of the goodies from the arcade version. If you want to play Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 at home, this really is the only way to go!the graphics are quite acceptable, the resolution is pretty low and we've all seen the Saturn do better.

Call of Duty Black Ops ll kicks butt!  Online is fun, but lots of different weapon attachments making it harder or worse than Black Ops.  We tend to do local fighting bots with one of my other friends.  We play on CTF and make it so the flag can't be returned.  Then we put it in the middle of the map and we jump off of a ledge or something and do a 360 spin w/snipers and try to either no-scope (not looking through the scope, but killing the guy) or quick-scope (looking through the scope, but shooting and not looking through the scope to and killing the guy.).

And Destiny has revived my enjoyment of gaming.,"I'm really happy that we purchased this PS3 500GB when our old PS3 80GB finally gave out. (Blinking red light). We considered getting the PS4, but we use our system mainly for DVD/BD, Plex, and Netflix, with minimal gaming, so we couldn't justify the extra cost. Besides, we love the DVD/BD remote for the PS3 rather than using the game controller for the movies.<br />As for the &#34;Destiny bundle&#34;, I'm truely enjoying playing again!! I haven't enjoyed a game this much since I gave away my XBox 360 with Halo, or the Ratchet & Clank games which I absolutely enjoyed playing for way too many hours. Destiny has much of what I loved about Halo plus the seemingly endless upgrades like in Ratchet.<br />In a nutshell, this PS3 500GB is awesome! Its more streamlined than our old PS3 and all my controllers are compatible!<br />Also, the Destiny bundle is a GREAT choice if you enjoy first person shooter games without all the blood and guts of some of the other titles, but still want all the great gameplay they offer. I'm looking forward to future &#34;Destiny&#34; releases. Keep up the great work Bungie and Sony.",2015-08-24

The FF games are my all time favorite games to play and the first to of the 13 trilogy were great but I did enjoy the change in the battle style from a turn based system they did a really good job and I am really excited for any more new FF series that will come out like the 7 remake and the 15 game that is coming out soon.

I wanted to replace the top and bottom shell parts and re-use the rest of the buttons from my busted controller, but the size of the cutouts/slots in the shell are ever-so-slightly different, such that the OEM parts from Microsoft will not fit seamlessly in it.  For example, the start/select buttons don't fit all the way in, the top RB/LB guard piece leaves gaps with the OEM RB/LB buttons, and the OEM RB/LB buttons leave gaps with the top and bottom shell when you try to reuse them in the new case.<br /><br /> Also, the OEM clear acrylic sleeve for the guide button LED does not fit in the central hole in this shell, which is a shame because the sleeve that is shipped with the kit doesn't have the little black strips built into it.  The end result is that when the controller number indicator LED is lit, the light sort of disperses all the way around the ring rather than being cleanly limited to one quadrant of the ring.<br /><br />All in all, these are fairly small gripes, and I just ended up using all the new shell parts with the old circuit board and triggers.

I have grown tired in the post-COD4:MW era of first-person shooters because I haven't found any COD game, or most FPS's related to it, worthwhile. The Battlefield series has been decent, and for me Destiny is really the only FPS over the past 7-8 years that I found truly worth the price tag (I am not a Halo fan). But Far Cry 4 combines above average FPS gameplay with a unique game environment, unpredictable open-world experiences, and a story that will keep you interested. This is something along the lines of Tomb Raider meets GTA for me, as the open-world of Kyrat, the fictional Himalayan setting of the game, is lush with environments full of enemies, diverse types of missions, and wild animals that will surprise the heck out of you when they attack. I haven't ventured into the online multiplayer much because I have been quite enamored with the story mode, but I'll provide an update once I venture into it.<br /><br />As for the story, it has an Uncharted feel to it: American protagonist ventures into an exotic land and fights a ton of villains. The protagonist, Ajay, is not that interesting himself but his comrade's and their enemies are very interesting characters. Also, the journey he is on is one of self-discovery, as Kyrat is the homeland of his late parents, and as their story unfolds, the game becomes more and more interesting. As with most open-world games nowadays, there is the main campaign and a plethora of side missions, all which seem to provide over 30 hours of fresh gameplay. This is the first Far Cry game I have ever played, so if fans of the series are used to the quality of gaming provided in Far Cry 4, I feel a bit foolish for missing out all this time. One of the things that I enjoy most are the variety of weapons present in the game (everything from a bow with flaming arrows to a bazooka). If you haven't explored this game yet, there's no reason not to buy it now that itis basically priced as a Greatest Hits title.",2015-08-24

There is a minor delay associated with the process of converting electrical input to wireless signal to audio again. It's a 0.1 or 0.2 seconds delay. Only noticeable if you got the TV and the Headset on at the same time. All and all, I'm very satisfied with my purchase.",2015-08-24

They did a very good job of bringing up to date the old Xcom games. Xcom: Enemy Unknown is a good remake of the originals. Xcom: Enemy Within brings in some nice additions to the game. What detracts are some game design decisions that are a bit frustrating, such as times when you do not have sight on an enemy but he shoots you anyway, or you can't shoot through a wall but they do and injure or kill one of your team. You can upgrade your original interceptors by not your landing craft to bring your team in. Your team members start out with ridiculously low stats. Really? You have this exception type of war all of a sudden forced upon you and you go in with a rookie team? Not Delta Force, not Rangers, not Seals, but rookies. I understand your not having the equal to their weapons, armor and such in the beginning and the need to research and develop to try and catch up, but rookies who can't hit the broadside of barn, really?<br />Even later when your team is well developed you can have the house size alien mech coming at you and you have a 90% or better chance to hit from you best people and they can't hit it. Right.<br />So saves are important because the game is designed to cheat in definite favor to the aliens no matter how late in the game it is.<br />But don't misunderstand the game is to quit good and enjoyable otherwise.",2015-08-24

I've played every entry in the series and they are all great in their own way. Even the worst Halo is better then the majority of its competition on the market. The master chief collection is the ultimate Halo fan tribute to a franchise that almost never disappoints. Now I will say that I play Halo more for the story then for the multiplayer, so my review doesn't really factor in any continuing multiplayer issues. If you're looking for the entire series playable in 1080p at 60fps, then you've come to the right place. My one major gripe is that Halo: Reach isn't in this collection.

I belong to a JRPG community online and after hitting chapter 5 I started doing some reading. A good amount of people ended up just giving up on the game. Not because of the difficulty, but because of the second half of the game. I have my characters at max level and a good amount of their jobs maxed out as well and am currently on chapter 8.

Well the answer is YES! The reasons are very simple from a gaming and entertainment stand point. Here are some things about the PS4<br /><br />1. The PS4 (basic system without camera) Comes with one Controller with charging cable (Micro USB cord so if you lose it you can just use your phone cord if you have android phone) Manuals on how to setup system. And A stock headset (cheap but works) and all power cords for system.<br /><br />2. Games- right now PS4 has lot's of games out right now that each home user has a game type you each can enjoy.  Also you can rent games through the PS Now program like old PS3 games and so on. &#34;But wait can't I just play my PS3 games o. The system? &#34; No No No you will have to buy them again on the PS4 and also your content will not transfer over<br /><br />3. Recording- now not a lot of people do this but if you do the PS4 had built in recording features so that the Twitch/YouTube peeps can integrate their game play with the system.<br /><br />4- What about movies and stuff and Netflix?<br />Yes you can still use that stuff and much more the entertainment package for the PS4 is quite large from Netflix to Vudu to youtube to Hulu they have an App for it.<br /><br />All in all yes get a PS4.,2015-08-23

You play as a 13 year old boy who is trying to become the best LBX player. LBX are small robots people use for battles.<br />The battles take place in real time in a boxed in landscape. Landscapes vary from volcanic, wooded, towns, docks, factories, arctic, ect. You can customize your robot with thousands of combinations from heads, legs, body, both arms, CPU, batteries, aux units, chips, the list goes on and on. Various types of swords, shields, hammers, axes, daggers, one handed guns, rifles, rocket launchers, pole arms, fist weapons, ect are what you do combat with. You can take battle items into a duel with you as well. These range from grenades, mines, healing items, stat protection, defense speed and attack buffs and many others. I'm about 16 hours in and am loving it. You can follow the main story or go off completing quests or just run around battling people in the streets, at school, in arcades, and many other places. I have yet to play any multiplayer so I can't comment on it. I do know I am enjoying every minute of this game.

Better functionality would be for them to be off until the power button on them is pressed to turn them on. Hopefully they fix this with a future firmware update, or at least give you an option to set it up like this. Right now we just keep the mic unplugged until we are ready to use them.

I do enjoy how 343 has combined 4 games in 1, the Menu, for example, highlights how easy it is to explore the features it offers. However, Multiplayer Matchmaking could be better. For one you can't quite the Lobby once the teams are made. But what if none of the three game-types offered interest you? You should be allowed to leave. Secondly, it sucks the game does not continue with the team you played previously, thus necessitating you to re-start matchmaking. Thirdly, there are few game-types for the amount of Halo's available. A Big Team Battle should be available for each halo, for example, as each game has it's perks. All in all, the fun thins out very fast from having to re-start matchmaking over and over again, with a limited amount of maps and games for each individual Halo. In the end, it was well worth it, as playing  the original Halo online was priceless. I am nervous about Halo 5, as the expectations of Halo MCC were high and the delivery was borderline.",2015-08-23

It glows in the dark, so I can switch off all the lights and plays games in a dark room.  But you know that already.  So I am gonna tell you about my experience with the customer service and warranty.<br /><br />I think the warranty period  for this controller is 90 days or something.  (Most game controllers and mice have  three to six month warranty.)  I think I bought this controller in May 2014, and its A-button broke in November 2014.  The internal spring of the A-button had lost its elasticity.  When I pressed the A-button, it would stay down and not bounce back up promptly.  That is a very common problem with the A-button because it is the one that is repeatedly pressed and abused the most.  So I called up the manufacturer, knowing that the warranty period had expired.  I had to call a few times because no one picked up the phone during the first few calls.  When I finally got to speak to a customer service rep, he told me not to worry about the warranty.  He told me to send the controller back, and they would send me a new one when they received the broken one.  I did not have to include the original box or packaging, a printout of the receipt or invoice, or anything else that originally came with the controller.  I just had to put the broken controller in an envelop and send it back.  I sent it back in its original packaging with all the original materials and a printout of my receipt from Amazon.  Then they send a new one to me within a week.  (P.S. Their office is located near where I live.)",2015-08-23

There's a little give to the buttons, but everything feels spectacular and solid in the hand. It works as expected, and I've been using this as my main remote on my Nvidia Shield TV even though I'm a gamer - it's so convenient, it replaced the gamepad in a heartbeat. The coolest bit? Sue me, but it's the glowing microphone button. It just looks so damn cool. Being able to plug your headphones into the bottom is a close second.<br /><br />I do have a few minor gripes with the controller. None of them bother me too much, but your mileage may vary.<br />1. Plastic parts get micro scratches easily, as does all plastic<br />2. I can't confidently grip this remote as I'm watching stuff on my TV, since the volume control is touch sensitive. Grip it too hard and your volume will start changing.<br />3. When I plug in my headphones to the port, it comes out relatively easily. There's no &#34;click&#34; or light lock to keep it in there.<br />4. No dedicated media control buttons. The layout is nice and as an artist who can appreciate simplicity and design, I get why they omitted it. But still, having forward/backward/play buttons would be much more convenient. Fast-forward and rewind is easily one of the biggest inconveniences on Android TV. The difference between using a touch screen to drag a slider vs holding a button to FF (or worse, select 4x speed like on DVD)players) is night and day.<br /><br />Overall it's a solid remote. The complains I have are mostly informative, so you know exactly what you're getting into. My experience with it has been great, and with the $25 promotion I would say it's a necessity to complement your Shield TV.",2015-08-23

US,25099208,R7Z042UL9J8OO,B00DHF39HQ,32807762,The Elder Scrolls Online,Video Games,3,3,6,N,N,Elder Scrolls Fan Fiction in MMO form,"I'm going to start off by saying that this is by no means a bad game; in fact, it's quite excellent for an MMO and as taken at face value. Where it goes wrong, I feel, is the Elder Scrolls part of it.  Notice that the game is made by Zenimax and not Bethesa Game Studios (Bethseda Softworks own both). They did as good of a job as they could, but it comes off almost as a fan fiction rendering of the series. I can't help but think while playing it that there's no way that this game will be considered part of the Elder Scrolls canon when they make the next single player ES RPG. Keep in mind while reading my review, that a lot of what I'm talking about was *not* explained in-game and that I figured out a lot of this based upon googling and just playing. It made the experience a little more frustrating than it had to be.  I started as a Nord in the Ebonheart Pact. Just like the other games, you have a choice of the various races (except Imperial class which you have to unlock) and you have a choice between the three alliances. The latter choice will set you in one world until you hit level 50 (in my case, so far, I have access to Dark Elf settlements, argonian areas, and nord areas as well as bits of skyrim here and there) and after that you have to clear the other two in order to complete the game. Once you hit level 10 you have access to the PvP section in Cyrodil, which I haven't much explored yet, but it seems you can become Emperor if you have the highest score on the winning team, which opens up a unique emperor skill tree. The premise, which is not intuitive at all, has you begin in ColdHarbour, the realm of the Daedric prince, Molag Baal. You learn that you are dead, that your soul removed was from your body, and that your goal, effectively, is to stop Molag Baal from breaking through into this world and to get your soul back. Back in Nirn, 1,000 years before the events of Skyrim, there is civil war brewing and the races are forming alliances that are competing for the throne as well as for control over all Tamriel.  THE GOOD: - It's addicting. Though my &#34;bad&#34; section seems to override the good, the only reason for that is because they chose to call this an Elder Scrolls game when they could have easily used the same exact system to create another MMO. It gets better as you play it.  - The main storyline, thus far (I'm at lvl 15), is pretty good. Not up to par with the previous titles but very good for the MMO genre. The main story, the guild storylines, and the overarching war lines are all good. It's the billions of random other ones that are a bit boring and come off pointless. I don't really care about most of the characters because they don't have any distinguishing characteristics or quirks that would make them interesting; all are cookie-cutter versions of each other and each race is a bit of a caricature. Despite that, still enjoyable overall.  - I like that the best way to level up is to complete quests. It just works well for this game.  - The multi-player integration is great too. I thought I'd hate it, but it was a bit fun to pair up with randoms for multiple person dungeons. It can be annoying at times when another player or players beat the boss just as you get there. You get credit for beating the boss without even throwing a punch. When that happens you have to be careful because sometimes when picking up whatever it is you needed from the boss, it respawns and starts hitting you. Hope they fix that. There are annoying sorts - children playing loud music, squeaky mics, domestic disputes - but you can always just leave the chat channel or the chat area. It's pretty much impossible for someone to ruin the experience for you, which is a nice touch.  THE BAD: -It's technically not free. You have to pay for a playstation plus subscription. I just paid for 3 months for $18, and given that, you get game discounts and free game downloads; it's really not that bad price-wise, but it is important to state thatdespite removing their subscription fee, it's still not free to play on consoles.  - The game is all in real time, so there is no saving or pausing. The no pausing drives me crazy because even when you're looking at your inventory or map, things/people can hurt and kill you. When you die, you have a choice to go to the nearest wayshrine or respawn using a full soul gem corresponding to your level. Also, the game logs you out after 20 minutes of inactivity.  - As mentioned, the fast travel system needs a bit of work. It's not intuitive and the PvP and PvE are not mutually compatible for fast travel, which is understandable, but there is no real instruction on how to travel to Cyrodil once you hit level 10 and it's a bit tricky to get back to the PvE engine from Cyrodil (I had to google this and look at multiple places before I figured it out).  - The leveling system, though I've heard that they've fix a few issues, is still ridiculous. What I dislike most about it is that there is no way really to get ahead with super cool armor or a cool rare weapon - every object is given a 'level' and you cannot use, equip, eat or drink anything that is above your level. I've gone ahead and completed quests that were way out of my skill range, received the rewards, only to just drop them off at the bank for storage until I hit that level. This also gives us no incentive to keep or store lower-ranked objects no matter what they are. I just destroy the objects below my ranking because there's no point.  - I feel no incentive to learn enchanting as you can easily find enchanted objects throughout the world. All the other skills such as provisioning, alchemy, woodwork, blacksmithing, leatherwork, etc are pretty boring, unnecessarily complicated, and it seems like everything is made at a much lower level than I'm at (since each of these traits have their own levels/skill trees). It makes it feel pointless, but then again, I haven't really been spending my precious skill points on any of these skills because as a non-subscriber, you don't get them very often.  - Every time you level up, complete a major quest, or collect 3 skyshards you get 1 skill point to spend. Those skills points can be used to purchase special moves, 'ultimate' abilities, or passive traits. There are a ton of skill trees, but when you don't have a subscription it takes a bit longer to level up, which makes it feel incredible slow and monotonous at times. When purchasing special moves for a weapon type (they have bow (all have infinity arrows), 1 hand/shield, dual wielding, two handed, and staff), you assign each move to a button on your controller. The fighting system is a little boring at times because you cannot do what i like to do, which is sneak around and pick people off, not only because of the system but because it seems like enemies respawn in the exact area within a minute (sometimes out of thin air which is annoying). As a lvl 15, I've unlocked weapon swapping but i haven't really utilized this yet.  - Graphics are cartoonish and disappointing in the context of next-gen tech.   - Both jumping and interacting are through the X button, meaning that if there is an interactable object in front of you, you will interact with the object instead of jumping. This was irritating when my character would get stuck between solid objects and I couldn't jump away because there was a damn crate in front of me.   - One of my favorite things about the ES games was that everything was interactable and the stories/characterization were always consistent. In this game, they've simplified its interactiveness. An example would be that you can only read one book from each bookshelf, each container if not empty has one random item in it, potions are just simply marked &#34;alchemy bottle&#34; or &#34;drink,&#34; you cannot see the stats for the weapons/armor laying around the world  without picking it up, and most items/dead people are non-interactable. There is literally no way to tell which items you can pick up or not unless you get close to them. As for the inconsistent characterizations/stories, it feels like a fanfiction. Playing in Ebonheart pact, I've noticed they've just pretty much thrown in flora/fauna from other games haphazardly. There is scathcrow all over the place (instead of just being near the volcanic/dark elf areas), there are the large Telvanni mushrooms all over the place (even though the lore states that they're special to that house of dark elves), every Argonian has a hypenated name, and every Nord is a boisterous drunk. Sounds a bit nitpicky,I know, but its those attention to details that really made me fall in love with the previous titles.  OVERALL:  NOT A BAD GAME. It is enjoyable for what it is and the ES title is what is going to get people to buy it. If you are an MMO fan, you will love this. If you are an Elder Scrolls fan, it could go either way. I play video games for storyline and immersion, so my gripes will not be the same as other people's gripes. I'd suggest people at least try it. I didn't like it at all at first, but as I'm cheap, I kept on playing and it sort of grew on me.",2015-08-23

I would recommend it for anyone how likes to play the game and has a few extra dollars,2015-08-23

It's annoying and there are no games that have the correct controls for the flappy paddles to be gear shifters. The great thing about the brake pedal is that I can use it as a clutch.

Really, the only reason I was getting a PS4 was to play Fallout 4 and Star Wars Battlefront, but they don't come out till November. The deal made me bite early. I'm glad I did!<br /><br />Close to the first thing I did was swap out the hard drive for a SSHD 1 TB drive as I knew the space on 500 GB would run out fast (trust me, Arkham Knight itself, even playing off a disk, requires a 50 GB install - so, 8 games and the drive would be full). The swap out was so painless and easy I couldn't believe it. granted, I have some experience with such things, but honestly, it was so easy anyone could do it.<br /><br />The drive came 1 day after the system, and I couldn't resist, so I spent the first day playing games on the stock hard drive. There were updates that needed installed, and then there were my save files. Transferring these to the new hard drive was effortless as well. On a USB 3.0 thumbstick (128 GB) it took me 35 minutes to copy 75 GB off the stock drive, and then after the new drive was installed and initialized, about 45 minutes to copy it back onto the system. I did it in between mowing the lawn and doing laundry and it was click and forget it for each step. set up the process, go mow the lawn, come back and it was done. perfect.",2015-08-23

Guys like Iron Man (easily my favorite hero to play with in the game) are better suited to use ranged attacks. However, if you're playing as Hulk or Thing, melee combat is pretty much your only option. If I can be honest, the combat isn't really fun, regardless of who you're playing as. It's a LEGO game, so I wasn't expecting much anyway. As for dodging or blocking incoming attacks; again, it depends on who you're playing as. If you're Captain America, you can use your shield to send projectiles flying back at the enemy. There's not a button dedicated to dodging, so if you're not playing as a character that has a shield, you'll be S.O.L. in some cases. Not to worry though, I pretty much went through the entire game without dying. Now that I think about it, I'm not sure you -can- die...<br /><br />Weaponry -- I know I sound like a broken record, but it depends on which character you're playing as. I'm not super familiar with the Marvel characters, so I'm not going to attempt to name all of these guys and their powers. If you're a Marvel fan, I'm pretty sure they have the same powers that they have in the comic books and movies. Captain America has his shield, Thor has his hammer, Storm uses her tornado, etc. I didn't play as too many different characters, so I only know of a couple of guys that can use the environment as a weapon, and that would be Hulk and Thing. I wish more characters could make use of the environment, such as the gameplay in Ultimate Alliance II. Oh my, I can't believe I just said something good about that game. I must not be feeling well...<br /><br />Enemies -- None of the enemies are difficult, and they're not very diverse. There are a few that use projectiles, but most of them just run at you and hit you. The heck with it, I'm just going to come out and say it. You can probably beat most of the enemies with your eyes closed. I found most of the boss battles to be pretty lame, except for the one against my favorite villain :-) Alright, here's how most of the boss battles go:<br />1) Destroy a fixture of LEGOs.<br />2) Use the scattered LEGOs to build a new LEGO fixture.<br />3) Use said fixture of LEGOs as a weapon against the boss, and he'll lose 1 heart of health.<br />4) Repeat steps 1-3 until you deplete all of their hearts.<br />This process is actually more lame than it sounds...<br /><br />Miscellaneous -- If you decide to play through the story mode and skip all of side-missions, it's probably a 15 hour game, at the most. There are a ton of side-missions, but I can't really speak to how much fun they are, because I only completed 2 of them. After completing a level, you'll automatically unlock free-play, which means you can replay the level and use any of the unlocked characters. Although this game is lacking in a lot of areas, it excels in providing challenging puzzles. I hate to admit this, but I relied on YouTube to aid me in a couple of puzzles, so beware. The main hub is in NYC, and I enjoyed driving around town, trolling some of the LEGO residents :-) I chose to only spend 15 hours on it, but there's definitely at least 50 hours of gameplay awaiting anyone that's interested.<br /><br />LEGO Marvel was just a filler game for me, and it served its purpose. I was very impressed with how complex some of the puzzles were, but the game as a whole was kind of meh at times (especially when I was unable to play as Iron Man). Although LEGO Marvel wasn't a great game, it was the perfect game to followup a brutal 88 hour slugfest like Bloodborne. I needed something light and vanilla, and that combination rarely results in 5 star game, so I think 3 stars is appropriate. Mad Max; you're up next!them just run at you and hit you.

Ever since I received it, there has been a steady flow of new content released which keeps it &#34;fresh&#34; (&#34;Stay fresh!&#34;). Everything in the game is a clever sea related word play. The story and premise is clever and original. Gameplay is smooth and fairly easy to learn but difficult to master, which makes it easy to keep interest. Matches are quick, so you don't have to commit an hour just to play a match - 3 minutes for standard play, 5 minutes or less on the more competitive ranked play. Matchmaking ensures you aren't playing against people way above your skill level, and doesn't let it get boring as you get better by giving you harder opponents as you advance. The bright colors are fun and make it interesting for kids/spouses.<br /><br />Cons:<br />I wish there was local multiplayer so my wife could play on my team. Instead we just take turns every other match.<br />There is occasional lag which provides an unexpected death, but that's forgivable every once in a while.<br /><br />Overall, while this is a shooter game, it doesn't feel that way. It feels more like a friendly game of paintball or laser tag. It's family friendly and ridiculously fun.",2015-08-23

I may just be a different kind of fan of video game genre or may have totally missed the mark on this one and souley purchased this because bungie was attached to the name but this game is NOTHING compared to ANY of the Halo franchise games. There is no storyline, or great video clips to get you excited about the next mission. It is the same brainless mission over and over again and when you do see others playing alongside you, no one is willing to join your party, play with you and half the missions are so difficult you get lost in it all. There are some areas that require a higher level to enter and actually defeat the opponents but the game never specifies or explains any of this.<br /><br />I personally am a fan of halo, mass effect, tomb raider, assassins creed, and uncharted... Not one of these games are even similar to this one. I absolutely hated every mission and felt empty after completing any quest.<br /><br />If you also were looking for games I mentioned..

Multiplayer is terrible--TERRIBLE!!! Before I start this review I have 10+ Years of computer networking experience, I have already configured my router to every possible combination, I.E port forwarding, NAT open, DMZ ETC!!! So it is NOT my network connection. Also all my other multiplayer games work flawlessly except for this turd. well were shall I begin, 1: It laggy you will glitch and get a so called &#34;rubber band effect&#34; 2. good luck finding more than 10 servers when doing server browser. Quick match works but it will stick you in a map by yourself with no other players 99.9% of the time. You have to constantly refresh. 3. Most of the servers you DO find are full and you will have to keep trying in the hopes that someone will disconnect . 4. All the other stuff is tolerable but THIS!!! is a deal-breaker. I WILL NOT!!!! stay connected to a server. So it takes 20 min to join a server then I start playing and after about 10 minutes I disconnect with some bogus error. this happens 9 times out of 10.

More of a challenge.<br />-The guns feel and look great on a piklelated screen.<br />-This games campaign is not the same on the console one, but they are both about two of the guys (Sgt.

Originally I only needed them because the left analog stick on my DS4 was wearing through and had a rip in it, which was annoying for gaming. I didn't want the rip to get larger so I searched for some grips, and at the time this is the best I could find. They're extremely grippy, and after hours of use they are still grippy which I see as a plus. Definitely makes using the DS4 controller a better experience and I don't have to worry about the analog sticks getting worse. These have lasted me a great while and have not noticed any wearing through, like I've seen mentioned in a few reviews. I use my DS4 heavily daily also, so it's not a lack of use. I would recommend these based off durability and prolonged use - especially to make your DS4 analog sticks last longer.",2015-08-23

Honestly it's a waste of money even at $20. There are numerous reviews around the internet of this game, and it's all pretty much the same, the gameplay is poor, the cars handle terribly, there is no realism in the AI, the career mode is poorly thought out, it's filled with bugs and glitches that are so obvious that they either didn't test it or just didn't care enough to fix what are some very glaring issues. It's basically a (standalone) update to NASCAR 14, but there are many things which they did nothing to update. For example, the NASCAR All-Star race in this game used a format that was used once - in 2012. I haven't played any installment of this game prior to this one, but that's a pretty glaring mistake, shows that the developers of this game either don't care about NASCAR, don't know what's in their game, or just don't care.

Cut into four distinctive and diverging chapters based off players' choices in-game, Geralt's journey stretches from lushly detailed forests to war ravaged wastelands, each of which hold beasts waiting to be felled and hugely entertaining side-quests to be completed.<br /><br />Combat is tactical and quite rewarding given patience and strategy. Slicing and dicing baddies, then breaking out a combo with magic runes and gadgets makes for massive fun. The game's visuals are beautiful on the 360, as well, particularly the great array of environments. Unfortunately, the game relies heavily on invisible fencing and has some awkward environmental navigation issues, often leading to frustrating situations that detract from the fun. Likewise, the game has a tough learning curve, so casual players may feel less compelled to stick with the lengthy campaign even on easier settings.
